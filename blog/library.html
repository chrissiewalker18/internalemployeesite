                <h3><a name="Post119">Oh the Places You'll Go!</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>The Road to 100 Percent</mark></i></h4>

                <p>We have come a long way since the firm first launched in 1979. 37 years later, we have grown from 5 employees working at the Research Counsel to over 2,800 at the Advisory Board Company. We’ve expanded our reach from a single office in Washington to 12 on 3 continents, including one in Chennai, India – over 8,500 miles and a 19-hour journey from D.C.</p>

                <h6 class="bluetext">Despite the many changes, certain core elements of the firm remain the same:</h6>

                <ul class="bullet points">
                    <li class="indent">Culture is a top priority. Our employees are a strong community that fosters career growth, personal connections, and no shortage of opportunity to make a difference.</li>
                    <li class="indent">We continue to create groundbreaking solutions in health care and higher education. Our mission is to make health care better, education smarter, and our communities stronger. And with every passing day, our teams demonstrate their commitment to each aim.</li>
                    <li class="indent">We partner with more than 230,000 leaders at over 5,000 organizations across health care and higher education and always put service to our members first.</li>
                <ul>

                <p>Another constant in our  history is the Health Care Advisory Board. Over the past 30 years, our flagship research program has supported CEOs, COOs and Board Members around the country in tackling challenges from care delivery redesign and health system strategy to payment transformation.</p>

                <p>Today, HCAB is the reigning champion of our membership in guiding hospital leaders, and counts nearly three quarters of all hospitals (72%) as part of the membership. Our role as go-to advisor grants us the privilege of serving as thought partner with the nation’s leading health care organizations and that two-way channel lends tremendous value to the support we provide to our members, across every program, service and technology. Simply put, having a seat at the table with the most senior, progressive executives in health care is critical to our business and allows us to serve all of our members better.</p>

                <p>But, such strong market position now poses a challenge – how can we continue to grow and close the gap? While every organization may not opt in to membership, we must all do our very best to help capture as much of the opportunity that remains for HCAB. Access to CEOs, allows us unparalleled insight into the top strategic challenges in industry and fuels our ability to fulfill our mission – to make health care better.</p>

                <h6 class="bluetext">As the posters decorating the D.C. office may have hinted, the Health Care Advisory Board is launching a new campaign, “The Road to 100 Percent.”</h6> 

                <p>The goal is for the firm to secure interactions with, or gather market intelligence from, the remaining HCAB prospect organizations in an effort to understand and capture as much of the remaining market opportunity as possible. Many of us speak or work with these organizations already—and likely have invaluable insight into the priorities and challenges they are facing.  Or why they may not join at this time, which is equally important for us to understand.</p>


                <h6 class="bluetext">The places our firm can go with new levels of insight from chief executives in every market are endless. Where should we start?</h6>

                <p>Please direct any leads, or introductions you may be able to make to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com?subject=I have an HCAB lead"><b>One Advisory Board</b></a>.

                <p>As the year comes to a close, the One Advisory Board team has a lot to be grateful for and we’d like to share just a few! Thanks to the hard work of the entire firm – for the first time ever – OAB Leads have contributed to $100M in NBB! This is no small feat and it is because of every one of you that 2015 will go down in the record books.</p>
                
                <p>Our team wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who submitted a lead this year. A few special shout-outs to the groups we harassed the most...</p>

We’re thrilled every time we get to chatter out a new medallions status achievement. So far this year, the numbers are <b>82 Platinum, 41 Gold, 102 Silver, and 527 Bronze</b> – meaning 752 of you have secured at least 1 visit from your OAB leads. WOW – color us impressed!</p>

We placed an extra hurdle in front of them at the beginning of the year – A Race to Qualify – and they rose to the challenge! At the beginning of H2, there were 64 lead passers pitted against each other in OAB’s Classic March Madness style tournament. Now – only two remain: <b>Sharon Shoham</b> and <b>James Millard</b>.

Dragons were tamed, principal teams were turned into white walkers, and many, many leads were passed. When the great war was over, <b>House Amoruso</b> had scheduled the most visits, earning their seat on the iron throne. </b>Team McKenna</b> was the principal team with the most visits scheduled outside the winning pod, earning them a reward as well. When you play the game of thrones, you either win, or you die… NASA teams learned to keep their friends close and their enemies closer, but even more commendable was the team work we saw in the midst of lead passing battle.</p>

Completing the final round with the most visits, <b>Rachel Wolfowitz</b> claimed the grand prize. <b>Caroline Leone</b> finished close behind her earning the second place prize.

                <h4><i><mark>He's just hiding in the newest C&amp;M Collateral</mark></i></h4>
                
                <img class="blogfloatimagetop" src="../img/blog/mcdreamy.jpg">
                
                <p>How did a Grey’s Anatomy reference sneak into Consulting &amp; Management’s latest piece of collateral, and what does it tell us about patient experience and <u><a href="http://one.advisory.com/blog/library.html#Post96" target="blank">access</a></u>?</p>
                
                <p>I don’t think it would be a stretch to say this is the first time McDreamy has graced the pages of Advisory.com—though it’s a hidden gem for members paying close attention.</p>
                
                <p>One-of-a-kind graphic <u><b><a class="bluelink" href="https://www.advisory.com/consulting/multimedia/2015/a-tale-of-2-visits#lightbox[pp_gal]/6/" target="blank">“Tale of Two Visits”</a></b></u> is an innovative new way to tell a story for the Advisory Board. It illustrates a step-by-step guide to a standard visit to see your doctor, and highlights the many ways in which this process has become synonymous with the word ‘waiting’.</p>
                
                <p>Here’s the twist though—the graphic juxtaposes the ‘hurry-up and wait’ nature of the current healthcare culture that is so prevalent versus a scenario where the physician’s office leverages an e-health portal, centralized scheduling, electronic registration to create a new experience for the patient.</p>
                
                <p>The patient’s experience is radically different for these two visits, and Consulting &amp; Management can help institutions make the transition to the seamless experience depicted under “the new way” in the <b>Tale of Two Visits</b>.</p>
                
                <p><b>Did you find McDreamy?</b></p>

                <p>This section of our blog will highlight <b><u><a href="../campaigns/medallionstatus.html">Medallion Status</a></u></b> lead passers at each level (Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum); honoring the creative, unique, funny, and impressive leads they have passed through to the One Advisory Board team this month.

                    <p><i class="platinum">#ThanksWalt</i> <br>This month we would like to give Walt Ecton a special shout out for sending in the most entertaining lead of the month. His use of hashtags and his in depth analysis of the amenities available at the Double Tree in Binghamton might not have helped to schedule a visit…but it did have the OAB team laughing out loud. And, since we know you’re all curious, here’s a little preview of Walt’s email:</p>
                    
                    <i><p>“Rachel and Sarah –</p>

                    <p>Happy Friday. Iain and his really big loser MA Camden force me to go on visits where we often don’t get back home until late Friday night, so just chugging away on the work emails on the plane here...<br>#ThanksCamden  #CamdenKillsOurSocialLife</p>
                    
                    <p>I wanted to provide you with some intel for your visit to SUNY Broome next week (copying One Advisory Board here).  The Doubletree in Binghamton is hands down my favorite hotel I’ve stayed in (to be honest, I was actually really emotional when I wasn’t assigned this visit).  This is perhaps irrational, but I truly love it and have quite fond memories there. It has such a great gym.  There’s a wealth of free fitness classes that are included.  It’s actually a full-service gym that has real local members, and Doubletree guests get access to all the facilities and wonderful amenities.  When I was there, most of the members were older, so it made me feel pretty buff.”</p></i>

                    <p><i class="bronze">Details</i> <br>Earlier this month, Alexa received a call from an assistant she had previously worked with at Tuscon Medical Center. Asking on behalf of their CNO, the assistant wanted to know if we did any work in the palliative care space (we do!). However, since this question did not fall under Alexa’s current product assignments she told the assistant that she would ask around and find someone to get in contact with the CNO as soon as possible. What made this lead particularly great was that when Alexa looped in OAB she included specific quotes from her conversations with the assistant and she included details like: “Emails from the advisory.com domain go straight into her spam folder, so she prefers phone calls”. Alexa’s clear notes not only helped to make this a strong lead, but we’re sure that they also made the next Marketing Associate’s job much easier. Great job, Alexa!</p>

                    <p><i class="honorable">Collaboration</i> <br>This month we also wanted to highlight Heather Miser and Erica Cordell for their teamwork on a lead at McLaren Health Care. At the end of November, Heather and Erica reached out to OAB regarding a Consulting and Management engagement they were working on which related to developing a service line plan for the cardiovascular and orthopedic service lines at McLaren. They were hoping to bundle Service Line Strategy Advisor (SLSA) in with this engagement, and given that McLaren was a previous member of SLSA, Erica and Heather knew that they would have to figure out how to effectively communicate the value that this would add to their Engagement. Through collaborating with OAB, Marketing, and the NASA team Heather and Erica were able to figure out a strategy for how to best position this sale. Go team!</p>

                    <p><i class="honorable">Hey Momma</i> <br>OAB wouldn’t typically recommend starting an introduction to a contact with “Hey Momma”, but in Amanda Faircloth’s case, this was a completely appropriate way to reach out to the System Director of Employee Development at Summa Health System. For this particular lead, Amanda connected with OAB after her Mom reached out to her over text message regarding “Leadership Academy pricing”. After receiving this text, Amanda reached out to OAB and she was able to provide an introduction for the appropriate marketer. We know that not everyone will have a relevant family member they can connect with about ABC products, but we still think that Amanda’s lead serves as a great reminder to utilize your connections (and potentially your texting!).</p>

                <p>We’ve all experienced the problems that come from miscommunication. For our health care members, miscommunication can have disastrous consequences for patients, but <b>seamless communication</b> can help prevent health problems and improve care coordination.</p>
                
                <p>For members taking on risk, care coordination is particularly important to patient health. With Crimson Medical Referrals, ACOs and CINs can not only keep more referrals in their networks by targeting referral coordination at the point of care, but also power market-wide communication and ensure seamless information sharing across the network. CMR provides a unified referral management platform for multiple users and appointment types. Here are the outcomes members can expect to see:</p>

                    <li>Boost in quality of care with clinical details attached to referrals and closed-loop information going back to the referring physician</li>

                    <li>Overall improvement in patient and physician satisfaction</li>

However, this month we wanted to give her an extra shout out for having 10 visits (that’s right, 10 visits!) scheduled from her leads. What’s her secret? Strong introductions, and not surprisingly, a large volume of leads. Great job, Leigh! Keep them coming! </p>

This probably doesn’t sound like the best time or place to uncover a lead, but after listening to the member, Jack was able to identify that many of his concerns could be addressed through our Solutions membership. With the help of LaWann Powers, Jack explained the basics of the Solutions model to the CNO and organized a Solutions proposal for November. Great job uncovering this one Jack!</p>

This past month, Cristina managed to pass a TON of leads while preparing for an internal transition. It’s not often that OAB sees this many leads come from one MA, so we loved seeing these come through our inbox. But, what was also impressive was how clearly Cristina outlined the products she was passing leads for, the background she had on the opportunities, and who she was passing the leads to. You definitely don’t need all of that information if you want to pass a lead (any amount of information is helpful!), but it definitely made our jobs easier!</p>

Even though this was not a formal meeting, Kalen identified interest in post-acute care pathway design and home health. He was then able to provide an introduction and strengthen a related marketing pursuit at Methodist Le Bonheur. We love this lead because it demonstrates one of the many avenues that leads can emerge from, and, if we’re being completely honest, the OAB team may have also been a little bit curious about the “Pineapple Room”.</p>

                    <p>Certainly not for most of us. But in the world of higher education, midterm grades can play a major role in determining a student’s path to graduation. In the face of increased budget constraints and rising student loan debt, colleges and universities are under enormous pressure to improve degree completion. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, our national 6-year completion rate hovers around 58% and the 4-year rate is even lower.</p>

                    <p>Fortunately, our experts with the <a class="bluelink" href="http://one.advisory.com/resources/eab/ssccampus.html" target="blank"><b><u>Student Success Collaborative</u></b></a> are here to help. Emerging research suggests that rigorous analyses of academic data can separate the hidden population of struggling students from the likely graduates, enabling targeted intervention efforts and ultimately improved outcomes.</p>

                    <p><i class="bluetext">So who do we need to target?</i> The <b>"Murky Middle”</b> —the sizeable but often overlooked group of students who manage to complete their first year with a GPA between 2.0 and 3.0 but still stand a good chance of dropping out before completing their degree.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>Introducing ABC's new product suite for struggling NFL teams</mark></i></h4>

                <p>Six weeks in to the NFL season, we’ve seen teams across the league show some incredible strengths and glaring weaknesses.  My Denver Broncos are among the greatest examples; the team with the near-undisputed best defense in football is being held back by a future Hall of Fame quarterback whose current arm strength is, sadly, equivalent to an eighth-grade ballet dancer.</p>

                <p>Though we at The Advisory Board typically work in health care and higher education, some of our most brilliant minds are working round-the-clock to adapt our memberships to help struggling NFL franchises with their most crippling deficiencies.</p>

                    <h6 class="honorabletitle">Washington Redskins: Crimson Market Advantage</h6>

                    <img class="leadpasser" src="../img/blog/SA_Redskins.png">
                
                    <p>The Redskins may not be a great team, but they’ve ridden a solid defense to a pair of wins in a division that is very much up for grabs. Their problem is the same as it’s been since the end of Robert Griffin III’s magical rookie season: the quarterback position. Kirk Cousins is about league average in passing yards, sitting in 16th with 1,420 on the season. Unfortunately, Cousins ranks fourth in the league in interceptions thrown, with eight picks to only six touchdowns.</p>

                    <p>Hospitals and health systems need to make sure their physicians are referring their patients to other physicians within the same system, rather than outside of it. <a href="http://one.advisory.com/resources/cross/cma.html" target="blank"><u><b>Crimson Market Advantage</b></u></a> enables health system leadership to understand their referral networks, and to ensure as much money is staying inside the system as possible.</p>

                    <p>At the moment, the Washington Redskins would like nothing more than to purchase CMA for their struggling quarterback; understanding exactly where passes will go and keeping them from benefiting competitors in the form of interceptions would enable the team to reap huge rewards in point differential.  While Crimson QB Advantage is still in development, CMA can offer the same benefit to health system leadership.</p>

                    <img class="leadpasser" src="../img/blog/SA_Eagles.jpg">
                
                    <p>A year ago, Chip Kelly, coach and effective GM of the Philadelphia Eagles, seemed like a man ahead of his time. Alas, a shocking off-season that saw him defy conventional football logic and an ugly start to the year have led many to doubt Kelly’s prowess as a manager of personnel.</p>

                    <p>The modern NFL theory on offensive backfields is that running backs are replaceable.  Meanwhile, Chip signed not one, but two high-profile running backs.  Spending $22 million on backs behind only $1.1 million of offensive guards has proven a poor choice, as a very expensive backfield has led the Eagles to be only the 13th best team in rushing efficiency.</p>

                    <p>Our <a href="http://one.advisory.com/resources/margin/hpm.html" target="blank"><u><b>Hospital Performance Management</b></u></a> service line in Consulting &amp; Management can help Chip deploy his resources in a way that will get him more wins—workforce efficiency is their bread and butter. HPM can help Chip look at the return he is getting from his RBs vs. his linemen, and decide where he can cut costs to build a better team. They can also help him forecast what skill mix he will need on his team to compete in the NFC East.</p>

                    <img class="leadpasser" src="../img/blog/SA_Titans.jpg">
                
                    <p>Across the first five weeks of the NFL season, one of many surprises was the Titans' effectiveness on defense. With a lack of star players and some replacement-level talent in starting roles, few expected the Titans to have an above-average defense.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://one.advisory.com/resources/eab/ssccampus.html" target="blank"><u><b>Student Success Collaborative</b></u></a> proactively identifies students who seem academically successful at first glance, but may actually show some warning signs. Using a sophisticated algorithm based on data from former students, SSC helps academic advisors guide students who are at risk of developing bad habits, or struggling in a certain trajectory.</p>

                    <p>By using SSC, the Titans coaching staff may have realized that their ostensibly successful defense was in fact based on an unsustainable trend. Despite being near the very bottom of the league in defending on first down, they were in fact the third <i>best</i> team in the league in defending third down, meaning the defense was able to get off the field more often. The Titans were allowing opponents to convert a mere 31.3% of third-down attempts, a statistic that would inevitably regress to the mean given their defensive struggles elsewhere. In week six the Titans were blown out by 28 points, thanks in part to the Miami Dolphins third down conversion rate of 55.6% during the contest.</p>

                    <p>This single game dropped Tennessee from 8th to 12th in defensive efficiency rating, a backslide that’s likely to continue. SSC can help advisors (and someday teams like the Titans) identify potential red flags in data and intervene before problems arise.</p>

                    <img class="leadpasser" src="../img/blog/SA_Patriots.jpg">
                
                    <p>In the very first quarter of NFL action this season, the Pittsburgh Steelers' coaching staff found themselves unable to use their headsets to communicate. In what is assuredly a coincidence, they were playing against the New England Patriots in Foxborough, MA.</p>

                    <p>In an odd and probably random turn of events, teams are clamoring for IT security when on the road against the Patriots. Luckily for all of those teams, ABC has <a href="http://one.advisory.com/resources/value/hcit.html" target="blank"><u><b>Health Care IT Advisor</b></u></a>. In the health care space, HCITA helps CIOs and other technology leaders best position IT priorities within the organization and gain buy-in from other executives. Equally important, it provides insight into the effect of payment reform on technology and guides CIOs towards the right technology investments.</p>

                    <p>Many NFL fans would probably target the Jacksonville Jaguars as a team that could use an assist from The Advisory Board. They historically rank among the worst teams in the NFL just about every season.</p>

                    <p>In theory, being a perennially struggling team should have a silver lining in the form of high picks in the annual NFL draft, but unfortunately the Jags have struggled to develop their young, inexpensive talent into meaningful contributors. With a top-ten pick in each draft from 2010-2012, the Jaguars came away with two disastrous choices, Blaine Gabbert and Justin Blackmon, and one slightly above-average player in Tyson Alualu.</p>

                <p><b>Lead Passer:</b> Spencer Graves<br>
                <b>Role:</b> Membership Advisor<br>
                <b>Department:</b> NASA<br>
                </p>
                
                <p><b>Institution:</b> Mayo Clinic<br>
                <b>Member challenge:</b> <i>“We are looking to develop a new business plan looking at market and best practices for sub-specialty pediatrics service lines.  Would you have any research that might be applicable?  Also, any examples of major referral centers for pediatrics keys for success, and supporting processes/infrastructure.”</i></p>
                
                <p>In order to be thorough, Spencer immediately reached out to our Research Associates in The Expert Center. However, he had a hunch that this could also be an opportunity for a Consulting &amp; Management engagement and connected with VP Alan Lassiter. It’s a good thing Spencer followed that hunch because this ended up being a huge NBB opportunity!</p>
                
                <p>After receiving resources from the research team, Spencer passed along direct links/attachments to ABC collateral and offered to make a direct introduction to Dr. Lassiter. He then closely monitored the follow-up conversations in order to see the lead to fruition.</p>
                
                <p><b>Product/Service:</b> Consulting &amp; Management Strategic Planning<br>

                <p><i>“I think it’s important to further your own leads to the point of an interaction, unless the lead is truly direct to visit/call (e.g. they say that they want to meet with someone or see a product).  I make an effort to own outreach to the member until they take me up on my offer to introduce them to a person or a product, at which point I hand it off to the MA to own scheduling etc.  Managing it that way, the follow-up on an offer seems more natural and less aggressive.  You can ask how the materials were received and if they were helpful, check to see if there’s anything else you can do. Make sure that they saw your offer for a conversation and check whether they want to take you up on it.”  – Spencer</i></p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li><b>Be quick to respond</b> – the timeline of every lead is different, but the sooner you can follow-up to the initial member ask, the better!</li>
                    <li><b>Be thorough</b> – there are a ton of resources available here at ABC, whether that involves reaching out to the research team/looping in an expert or <u><a href="../resources/abctown.html" target="blank">checking out what OAB has to offer</a></u> (*be sure to follow the external resources link for materials to share with members!)</li>
                    <li><b>Make direct introductions</b> – these tend to be the most successful leads; one-pagers and other collateral are great, but the sooner you can set up that interaction with a real person (e.g. Marketer or C&amp;M exec), the better!</li>
                    <li><b>Follow the lead</b> – it’s easy to forget about a lead once you’ve already involved other people; however, the more you pay attention to follow-up conversations, the more likely you are to ensure that your lead results in a visit or NBB (and to make sure that you get credit for it!)</li>
                    <li>And, as always, <b>don’t forget to copy/blind copy OAB!</b></li>

                <h3><a name="Post101">A Guide to Perfume Types</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>SNF SNF the full Post-Acute care spectrum</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Picking a signature fragrance — for you or someone else — can be tricky. It needs to perfectly capture the essence of the person who will wear it, and of course, smell amazing.</p>
                
                <p>You think choosing the right fragrance is important? Try choosing your post-acute provider partner. But don’t worry—the <u><a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/post-acute-care-collaborative" target="blank">Post-Acute Care Collaborative</a></u>, now working with over 2,000 facilities nationwide, can help. We serve the entire spectrum of post-acute and long-term care providers.</p>

                <p>Below are some basic notes to consider when picking the right fragrance…or post-acute provider:</p>
                
                <ul class="numberedlistspaced">
                    <li><b class="bluetext">Floral:</b> A self-evident category of fragrance notes, directly smelling of fragrant blossoms, often rich in nuance. The smell of home, akin to home health care and hospice facilities.</li>
                    <li><b class="bluetext">Oriental:</b> A fragrance family that uses rich notes of vanilla, balsams, sandalwood, patchouli and musk to create a heady, sensual aura. The skill it takes to master this scent is much like Skilled Nursing Facilities, including outpatient therapies and subacute rehab. </li>
                    <li><b class="bluetext">Citrus:</b> The citrus essences are expressed, or cold-expressed in most cases, to preserve their inherent freshness. Citruses provide a refreshing quality to fragrances, accounting for the top note which tickles our noses with pleasure. So fresh and so clean, like long-term acute care and inpatient rehab facilities within our member hospitals.</li>
                    <li><b class="bluetext">Woody:</b> Evoke the dry, resin-like scent of pencil shavings. Some materials can smell woody even though they are not woods: the grassy plant patchouli smells dry, pungent, earthy and woody. Ah, the scent of Senior Living, like independent and assisted senior living facilities. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>This is important for your members — <b>did you know we now work with hospitals?</b> It’s true, so the next time someone mentions they like the smell of citrus, make sure to pass a lead to the PACC team.</p>

                <h3><a name="Post98">Turning the OR Into Cash Cow</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>How using Data Can Turn Inefficient Surgeons into Top Performers</mark></i></h4>

                <p>The United States wastes about 2 million pounds of unnecessary surgical supplies every year – 20 to 30% of an average hospital’s total waste – or around $15 million annually.  Most of this waste is preventable, and because there is always added scrutiny when looking at a hospital’s most profitable revenue streams, 80% of hospital executives are looking to reduce supply costs and improve revenues from the OR.</p>

                <p>Inefficient surgical behaviors coupled with the use of costly supplies can be detrimental to a hospital’s bottom line – and this is where the Advisory Board comes in.  Surgical Profitability Compass (SPC) tackles all of these issues, not only helping organizations with efficient OR calendar management, but also helping them track which supplies cost the most and if costlier supplies actually lead to better patient outcomes.  In many cases, SPC demonstrates that expensive tools may not lead to better outcomes, allowing leadership to leverage data to facilitate productive conversations with surgeons about their preferences.</p>

                <p>Montefiore Medical Center, one of the Advisory Board’s stand-out SPC members, recently hosted a webconference (recording found <u><a href="https://www.advisory.com/Technology/Surgical-Profitability-Compass/Events/On-Demand-Webconferences/2015/Montefiore-Medical-Center-Save">here</a></u>) where their Director of Perioperative Services and an active surgeon, Dr. Pratt, spoke about a situation she was facing.  Dr. Pratt enjoyed being a surgeon and leading her team, but after seeing her own data in the SPC dashboard, she had to accept the fact that she was not the best steward of the hospital’s resources.  She needed help… and needed to fix her own utilization problem.  Dr. Pratt underwent three phases that helped her change how she looked at her own performance:</p>

                <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                    <li><b>Denial.</b><br>After receiving her data, Dr. Pratt was in disbelief. “I do not spend this much,” she claimed. “There is no way I am the most costly surgeon in this OR.”</li>
                    <li><b>Reconciliation.</b><br>After a week of confirming the data and looking more closely at her own behaviors, she used SPC to identify which supplies were the most costly, and began triaging data to her team about their supply costs.</li>
                    <li><b>Hope.</b><br>Over time, Dr. Pratt saw her utilization of costly supplies decrease, and she began to have productive conversations with surgeons about their behaviors and preferences.  There was hope for this department – and SPC paved the way.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Dr. Pratt took trustworthy data, went on a mission, and it clearly paid off. Over the course of 14 months, Montefiore saw <b>savings of more than $2.6 million</b> by focusing on supplies that could maximize savings. By the end, she had taken her own cost-per-case from the highest to the lowest in the hospital’s system. </p>

                <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/CashCow Graph.png">

                <p>Dr. Pratt also led Montefiore Medical Center in value analysis conversations which allowed for more favorable contract negotiations, leading to <b>lower overall supply costs moving forward.</b> Finally, with surgeons being incented on quality and patient-satisfaction, it was essential for the team to see where quality wavered because of supplies, an easy piece of data to pull through the tool.</p>

                <p>Surgical Profitability Compass was able to save Montefiore Medical Center millions of dollars in OR supplies, and will hopfeully make a dent in reducing the amount of total OR waste across the country.  Moreover, with the help of our DA team and by being self-aware, Dr. Pratt was able to reduce her cost-per-case, improve the quality of her care, and lead a positive movement for change across a team of surgeons who work with patients every day.</p>

                <p>So you’ve been around the firm awhile, and you know a thing or two about Patient Access. A quick search on Advisory.com indicates there are <b>3,886</b> resources tagged to this topic. Oh. That’s a lot. Well, you always could quickly skim through the 106 research briefs on the topic, or maybe watch the 232 on-demand webconferences. <b>The point is:</b> it’s a popular term that’s been adopted across the health care industry to with different meanings for different people in different departments.</p>

                <p>To many at ABC and in the industry, it refers to a critical component of the revenue cycle wherein the provider registers patients, verifies their insurance, and focuses on point-of-service cash collection. That definition is right. <b>But there is another right answer here:</b> <u><a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/market-innovation-center/the-growth-channel/2014/08/patient-access-means-something-different-to-everyone" target="_blank">making sure that patients get the right care, at the right time.</a></u> We have a few tools that speak to this second definition, notably HealthPost, CMR, and Audience Rx.</p>

                <p>So why is Consulting &amp; Management launching a new engagement centered on the second definition of patient access? Is it, as we like to say at ABC, a big “up at night issue”? Simply put, no. Or, rather, it’s not until it really, really is. Why is that? Because the symptoms of a larger patient access issue are disparate, and it isn’t obvious until all the separate small issues roll up to the CEO that these add up to something on a bigger scale.</p>

                <p>There is no Chief Access Officer (well actually, I found one in Salesforce but this person is tied to the revenue cycle definition). So issues surrounding virtual visits, same-day access, retail partnerships, call centers, bringing in new patients, marketing, keeping old patients in-network, expanding practice hours for physicians, and scheduling don’t all roll up to the same individual until it the CEO pieces all these symptoms together.</p>

                <p>Consulting &amp; Management is dedicated to helping our members solve the root causes behind multiple symptoms that the organization is encountering, <b>and do so by leveraging the resources the provider has already invested in. What should you listen for?</b></p>

                <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                    <li>Our patients struggle to "get in" with our providers.</li>
                    <li>We're striving for an "open/on-demand access" model.</li>
                    <li>Our practices aren't efficient and/or our providers aren't productive.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>And how might you know to pass a lead for Patient Access consulting instead of one of our other products, for example HealthPost? Often you will hear the member say something along the lines of, "we want to fix our processes before automating them."</p>

                <p>What can you ask to get the conversation started?</p>

                <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                    <li>How are you meeting your patients’ needs to access care in a timely way?</li>
                    <li>Is provider and appointment capacity aligned with demand?</li>
                    <li>How are you engaging staff and providers to meet patients’ expectations for access to care?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Do you bring your own bags to Trader Joe’s? Print double-sided to save trees? Use the soda machine instead of buying your (much needed) Diet Coke in plastic bottles?</p>

                <p>Well, here’s a whole new way to reduce, reuse, and recycle: Send those non-hospital leads (that might not be so useful to you) to the Health Care Industry Committee! You’ll see how one account manager’s trash might just be a marketer’s treasure.</p>

                <p>The Health Care Industry Committee is a research-based membership that’s available to all health care organizations that provide or support health care delivery outside the framework of a hospital. Think architecture firms, IT companies selling software to hospitals, medical technology, and pharmaceutical firms.</p>

                <p>Over the years, we’ve learned that a lot of our best opportunities are the ones that our colleagues—that’s you—find! We know a lot of random organizations may be reaching out to you for help—but before you decline, think of the 3 R’s and HCIC.</p>

                <p><b class="bluetext">Here's a quick guide:</b></p>
                
                <ol class="numberedlistspaced">
                    <li><b>Reduce:</b> By finding these new organizations and passing them to the HCIC team we can all help reduce the amount of noise in the market. HCIC will gladly take these opportunities off your hands—and guess what!? There are nearly no restriction clearances in Salesforce for HCIC, so we can follow-up with these leads fast.</li>
                    <li><b>Reuse:</b> While these organizations may seem random to you—they could be the next member of HCIC, so let’s reuse our resources and send them to the Industry experts.</li>
                    <li><b>Recycle:</b> When you send your leads to HCIC don’t forget to copy OneAdvisory@Advisory.com and get credit towards awesome trips and cash in your next pay check.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>This public service announcement has been brought to you by the Health Care Industry Committee. So remember, the next time you want to discard an organization, think Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and send them to HCIC—it might mean a new membership for a prospect AND some extra money in your bank account.</p>

                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/audiencerx.jpg">
                
                <p>Back in June, we introduced you to Audience Rx through a speed dating session. A few weeks ago, Audience Rx teamed up with HealthPost to offer our members an even more comprehensive consumer marketing and engagement solution.</p>

                <p>Now, find out if the new and improved solution is the right match for your member in less than two minutes.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">What do you do?</b></p>
                
                <p>Essentially, I am a digital marketing command center for marketing teams at hospitals and health systems. I help members make the transition from traditional advertising (think billboards and newspapers) to digital advertising (websites, social media, emails, etc.) much easier. I also help members give their health care consumers convenience. Targeted digital marketing campaigns paired with seamless online scheduling helps patients find and access the care they need quickly and easily.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Tell me more.</b></p>
                
                <p>I love what I do. I help members better understand who to target for services and how to target. I can calculate ROI from their marketing campaigns so they can see the impact of their advertising efforts. Finally, I help them fully engage their patients with real-time online appointment scheduling while also offering customizable appointment types to cater to physician preferences.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">What is the one thing about you that you want me to know?</b></p>
                
                <p>I’m extremely supportive. Members will have a dedicated resource – an in-house digital marketing expert who can develop, optimize, and manage digital marketing campaigns much like an agency would. I’m there to help guide them through implementation and provide strategies for getting their internal teams on board with using the new technologies.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">What do you look for in a relationship?</b></p>
                
                <p>I look for someone who is interested in the same things I am: digital marketing strategy, online strategy, patient access, consumer engagement, measuring closed-loop ROI, executing and managing multi-channel marketing campaigns. I tend to get along well with members of Crimson Market Advantage, Crimson Medical Referrals, and the Market Innovation Center (formerly Marketing and Planning Leadership Council).</p>

                <p><b class="bluetext">Which members should you share this with?</b></p>

                <p>Members who are conflating patient experience and satisfaction—the first addresses everything from the front office to billing, while the second is linked to the patient’s interaction with the physician and the services s/he provide (bedside manner, quality of care, etc.)</p>

                <p>Members who might think portals are catering to millennials. Rivka shares an interesting fact that patient portals are used by young and old alike.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>A look inside ABC's new podcast</mark></i></h4>

                <p>Some of you may be aware of the Weekly Briefing, ABC's new podcast hosted by Dan Diamond. It’s a lot like the Daily Briefing, only…well, weeklier.</p>

                <p>On the Daily Lead, we’ll be sharing with you a quick recap of the podcast, why you should listen, and which members you should share it with.</p>

                <p>This week covers the first episode, “Mega-Mergers and Pilot Programs” that aired on 7/23.</p>

                <p><b class="bluetext">Why should you listen to this episode?</b></p>

                <p>Ever wonder what Rob Lazerow names his fantasy football team? Yes, it is health care related.</p>
                
                <p>You get to hear Dan talk about drones—he paints quite a picture of DC with drones zooming around delivering medicine. Sounds a little like Blade Runner (1982).</p>

                <h3><a name="Post86">What Would You Do With 12 Extra Minutes<br> in Your Day?</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>PayNav helps some make $277</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Every time you step into a hospital, their office needs to know how they are going to get paid.  And in most cases, figuring that out takes around 15 minutes in the Patient Access department.  However, with an automated technology like Payment Navigation Compass, organizations can financially clear a patient – confirm what portion of care insurance will cover, provide an accurate price estimate, and build a patient payment plan – <b>in under 3 minutes</b>. That’s 12 minutes back!</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">Do you know what you could do with 12 minutes? You could:</h6>
                
                <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                    <li>Respond to 5 emails (and delete 5 more)</li>
                    <li>Watch 1/5th an episode of the Bachelor</li>
                    <li>Blink 5040 times</li>
                    <li>Run at least a mille</li>
                    <li>Listen to Taylor Swift’s “Shake it Off” three times</li>
                    <li>Take a walk around the block and take two selfies</li>
                    <li>Think about the 3000 babies that were just born</li>
                    <li>Feel your heart beat 960 times</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Just like everyone else, patient access teams want time back in their day, but they also want to provide a better experience and more efficient care for patients—as well as increase point-of-service collections.</p>
                
                <br>

                <h6 class="bluetext">PayNav helped these organizations get back minutes <i>and</i> revenue:</h6>
                
                <ul class="numberedlistspaced">
                    <li>Hunt Regional Medical Center spent 20-40+ minutes on each authorization call (one piece of the clearance process); but now they spend seconds getting authorizations through PayNav.</li>
                    <li>Mountain States Health Alliance saved 1,120 hours across 2014 in patient access team performance efficiencies.</li>
                    <li>UHS saves 8-10 minutes per account by using Authorization Compass (a module of PayNav) instead of finding clearance manually.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Our research shows that if a hospital can provide an accurate estimate of a patient’s care, that patient is more likely to choose that hospital and be more satisfied with their service (even if another hospital may end up being cheaper later on).  But <b>only 9% of surveyed hospitals are able to provide accurate estimates of patients’ obligations!</b> Every day, our PayNav technology is financially clearing patients, providing them with accurate estimates of their care, and helping organizations collect payments at the point-of-service.</p>
                
                <p>With a slew of case studies in our library, we have examples of hospital systems <b>increasing POS collections by $7M annually</b> (CHI St. Luke’s Health), <b>reducing administrative/denial write-offs by $1M</b> (Holyoke Medical Center), and improving their staff’s productivity and efficiency by hours – making certain that they can get everything done they need to in those extra 12 minutes.</p>

                    <p>Studies show that 70% of consumers are more likely to accept a physician’s recommendation despite having their own doubts, while 64% of consumers learn about health conditions themselves rather than rely on doctors to tell them what they should know. Having a two-pronged approach that appeals to both the physicians and the patients themselves ensures that organizations win a larger patient share.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because of this shift to consumerism, CMA has partnered with Audience Rx to provide members with a comprehensive picture of growth in their market.

               <h3><a name="Post82">"Members" From Elevate Tell All With OAB!</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Light as a feather, stiff as a board member.</mark></i></h4> 

                <p>In case you didn’t have a chance to meet our “members” at Elevate’s Member Impact Expo, don’t fret! They may be a bit flimsy on their feet, but they offered some very substantial insights.</p>

                <p>We asked how each of them how the Advisory Board and EAB have impacted their organizations – here are just a few things they had to say.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Chief Executive Officer Bob:</b><br> Our CFO left us unexpectedly a few months back, and that put us in a threatening situation. That’s a tough position to replace. But Advisory Board was right there for us placing an interim CFO with real experience to ensure quality leadership during our search for a long term replacement. Ultimately, we hired someone internally who had learned all kinds of great skills through a Leader Development Program last year.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Chief Financial Officer Lydia:</b><br> Last year, we looked at our performance benchmarked against other organizations, and it became clear that we were leaving money on the table. Revenue Cycle Consulting came in and completely redesigned our payer contracts team and streamlined collections.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Chief Medical Officer Rebecca:</b><br> Having performance focused conversations is a huge need in my role. Performance Technologies like CCC give me a true picture of physician performance, and insights from PEC provide real best practices on how to have those often tough meetings.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Chief Operating Officer Gary:</b><br> Our hospital faces huge competition, so I need a better way to reach health care consumers directly. Advisory Board gives me access to the best marketing and advertising best practices, and my brand new AudienceRX tool is allowing us to execute direct-to-consumer marketing campaigns, and track success and ROI.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Provost Herbert:</b><br> States are cutting budgets at the same time as our costs are going up – often I am not sure if our university will still be around ten years from now. Research available through my AAF membership lets me sleep easier at night because I have the tools I need to craft a long-term strategic plan.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Vice President of Student Affairs Andi:</b><br> Campus safety is a huge issue – it may be in the news now more than ever, but it has always been a top concern. The Student Affairs Forum gives me access to best practices from around the country, and allows me a platform to share what works at my university.</p>

               <h3><a name="Post81">Elevate Your Memories</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Unforgettable Moments From ElevateLive! 2015</mark></i></h4> 

                <p>Last week, we elevated our firm, our community, our members, and even our rocket launching knowledge. For all of us on the One Advisory Board team, the best part of the ElevateLive experience was greeting faces old and new at the OAB table. With your help, we celebrated hundreds of blog sign ups and OAB selfies, while Guerilla-ing The Gaylord with OAB buttons.</p>

                <p>However, this was just one of countless memorable moments that took place at National Harbor. We laughed, we cried, we danced, we shared secrets, stood in long lines, took hundreds of selfies, and – hey wait... is that a token?!</p>

                <p><h5 class="bluetext">Without further ado, here's what we'll <i>always</i> remember from ElevateLive!</h5></p>
                
                <ol class="numberedlistspaced">
                    <li>When Scott Schirmeier asked for our opinion on the visual appeal of his backside.</li>
                    
                    <li>When Robert admitted that Scott's aforementioned backside comment was consuming his thoughts.</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Rubenstein taught us his (not yet proven) hypothesis on the inner workings of the human immune system, i.e. “If you slow down, then your immune system will slow down, and the germs will get in.”</li>
                    
                    <li>When we learned that working with Scott Schirmeier could apparently be described as “Chinese water torture”. (No judgment – Elevate was a safe space.)</li>
                    
                    <li>When the line to the gumball machine was longer than any line for any theme park ride at Disney World. Ever.</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Rubenstein announced he would like to be buried in his plane. (David, we would like to be buried in your plane as well. Can this be arranged?)</li>
                    
                    <li>When Ted Livermore used his comedy act at the ABC talent show to expose his complicated feelings toward elevator conversation (note: when riding the elevator with Ted, one must not be frivolous with the small talk emerging from one’s “mouth hole,” particularly if it involves weather, or half-hearted commentary on the day of the week.)</li>
                    
                    <li>When the Nationals’ racing presidents encouraged us to turn up, rather unexpectedly. (Our only critique: The performance should have concluded with Robert emerging from beneath the headpiece of one of the costumes.)</li>
                    
                    <li>When the talented high school marching band was even more effective in pumping us up than the unlimited coffee carts. (Though we also hoped Robert would ascend the stage from the center of the drum circle on a moving platform, arms outstretched... We had our hearts set on dramatic entrances.)</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Rubenstein taught us about “Panda Porn,” and we felt inspired to explore creative solutions to help our members avoid extinction.</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Bradley shared a letter he received in 1999 from "Holly Bennett", a British sculptor who had absolutely <u>no</u> interest in attending the Cardiovascular Roundtable.</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Bradley got real with us about life and love, sharing three pieces of truly awesome fatherly advice: <br><b>#1</b> "Happiness is an expression of your gifts", <br><b>#2</b> "life is a series of up and down curves – nothing good happens at the top of the curve, and the bottom of the curve is a bitch, but that’s where all the good stuff happens", <br><b>#3</b> "achieving great romance is your single most important privilege, and the one decision you don’t want to get wrong."</li>
                    
                    <li>When David Bradley followed up on the above stating, “Elevate would be more memorable if some number of you went out and fell into heedless chemical love,” volunteering Robert as the relationship coach to every individual in the firm.</li>
                    
                    <li>When we waited tirelessly to get our Harborfest t-shirts screen printed by hand, and it was <i>totally</i> worth it.</li>
                    
                    <li>When we got tokens, found tokens, or gave tokens away – in many cases this was even more thrilling than redeeming said tokens. (It’s the little things!)</li>
                    
                    <li>When we geeked out with the President of SpaceX, and the OAB team made plans to relocate to a remote office on Mars.</li>
                    
                    <li>When we heard a rumor that someone drew <i>two</i> Apple iWatches from the gumball machine in a row (who are you mystery person?? Are the rumors true?) We remain hopeful in our search for the ever-elusive double iWatch Jane Doe.</li>
                    
                    <li>When we got to witness many-a-selfie photo shoot with our cardboard cutout Provost Herbert at the Member Impact Expo - the camera loves him! #Herbertstagram.</li>
                    
                    <li>When an epic flash mob broke out at Harborfest, and we all had serious FOMO* witnessing the impeccable choreography.</li>
                    
                    <li>When Spin Impact took over, transforming the dining hall/beach boardwalk/carnival site into a high-energy SoulCycle-esque workout facility, and totally crushed it!</li>
                    
                    <li>When we sat in one room with more than 3,000 individuals who collectively make ABC a truly special place to work, and felt empowered by the impact we make each day.</li>
                
                </ol>

                <p><b>*</b> <i>FOMO: An acronym for the “Fear Of Missing Out”, often used to describe that overwhelming feeling when you long to be a part of something that is seriously cool.</i></p>

               <h3><a name="Post80">An Insider's Perspective from the Executive Team</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>OAB Catches up with Scott Schirmeier</mark></i></h4> 

                <p>OAB recently had the opportunity to sit down with Scott Schirmeier to talk about his current work with the EAB and about One Advisory Board in general – here’s what he had to say.</p>

                <p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> Thanks for taking the time to chat a bit today, Scott. One thing that I think the firm is dying to know more about, and which you have been as close to as anyone, is the Royall partnership. Can you shed some light on where you see value there?</p>

                <p><b>Scott Schirmeier:</b> Royall has an amazing set of capabilities and services which are impacting universities across the country and eventually around the world. If you think about our ambition within the higher education space, the hope is that, bringing together Royall and EAB, we can have a huge positive impact on student success as a whole. It starts with helping build relationships between universities and students in high school so that student has the ability to pick the right school and the right program for them.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> So Royall and EAB can help bridge that gap between student and university?</p>

                <p><b>SS:</b> Yes. Once the student arrives at school, the work that we have done through our syndicated research on hardwiring student success and through SSC ensures that as many students graduate as is possible. And then, down the road when we think about new products, we want to also help those students get jobs and in turn give back to the schools. So this <b>student lifecycle</b> concept is pretty amazing.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> Given the collaboration both with Royall and with GradesFirst, where do you see EAB in five years.</p>

                <p><b>SS:</b> We just had a Board Meeting this spring where we mapped out the five year growth strategy and, overall, it comes back to the student life cycle framework. At our core as a company, we have great insights coming out of the research team and technologies to help members hardwire and support those insights. And now a growing set of services that can help members solve the gnarliest problems. And so I think we have a very robust research agenda - jobs, annual giving, an opportunity internationally, our community college space is growing consistently - and so I think you'll see a lot more products providing member value and a go-to-market strategy that mirrors health care. </p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> How can One Advisory Board help support this mission and this growth? </p>

                <p><b>SS:</b> If we don't help a member, some other partner will. So the ambition of all of our employees should be to listen and be stewards of the firm. We have an incredible OAB team which does all of the work for you, which has created a trusting relationship such that if you pass a lead you know it's going to be handled with care and grace and at the highest standards. There is no better, no more efficient channel in the firm to successfully convert prospects to new members while reducing the noise and the asks. And there is no more way to be responsive to our member's needs by listening and helping them solve a particular issue.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> You worked with a lot of leads, you have seen a lot leads, you have followed up on a lot of leads, you have passed a lot of leads; what do you think makes a really good lead?</p>

                <p><b>SS:</b> Let's imagine you and I are at dinner as part of a conference. And over dinner, I discover that you have a burning issue which is struggling with student retention. The best possible lead would be for me to be explicit – saying “ It sounds like retention is a huge issue for your university. With your permission tomorrow I'd love to send you an email to introduce you to my colleague who is expert in this area. You should spend 20 minutes speaking with her over the phone to see if we can help.” So number one, I'm setting the expectation that I'm going to follow up. Number 2, I'm sending an email thanking you, and making it personal based upon the conversation we had. And number 3, I’m referencing back your specific problem, and then introducing you to my colleague who can follow up. In other words, it's a very warm, person to person lead which is very different from throwing something over the wall with no introduction, no context, and no background information. The process I articulated 100% of the time will lead to a next step, and that should be the ambition.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> Final question about OAB - What do the executive team talk about when they talk about OAB?</p>

                <p><b>SS:</b> I think what the executive team talks about is it is one of our greatest assets as a firm. If you think about our mission and values, right, and one of them is Spirit of Generosity, I think folks are generous in sharing information and intelligence with one another. It’s one of the greatest things about our culture. I think the belief is also that it's a key to our growth - it has been for the last decade and will continue to be for the future. And what I love is that the senior most executives are best in firm at this. So David, who is our President, probably sends more leads than just about anybody in the executive team, and it's because he's constantly talking with members, he's engaging in conversation, he's trying to help. If we had 100 Davids at the senior level, we'd be in great shape because he's amazing at this.</p>

                <p>Huge thanks to Scott for his time – these are great insights, both into the fastest growing segment of the Advisory Board’s business and into how each and every member of this firm can be a steward for growth.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>#TravelTuesday</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Today’s post concludes the H1 Travel Tuesday column, as OAB’s “Around the World in 180 Days” campaign has officially come to an end. Throughout H1, Dedicated Advisors and Consultants from Cost &amp; Ops Delivery, Rev Cycle Delivery, Crimson Delivery and EAB Delivery have competed in month long rounds, working to meet difficult metrics in order to stay in the running for the grand prize.</p>
                
                <p>Ten contestants remained in the final June round, and were tasked to finish the month with the most visits scheduled off of OAB leads passed in H1. Rachel Wolfowitz from EAB Delivery stole the competition with 11 visits, making her OAB’s top “traveler!” Rachel now has her pick of a 5-day vacation in one of three incredible locations: The beautiful <b>Amalfi Coast of Italy</b>, the vibrant city of <b>Rio De Janeiro, Brazil</b>, or the <b>Great Barrier Reef in Australia</b>. We can’t wait to see where she goes!</p>

                <p>Caroline Leone finished in 2nd place with 9 visits in the final round, earning her a <b>4-day “staycation” anywhere in the United States</b>. Congrats to both winners!</p>
                
                <p>All participants consistently demonstrated strong lead passing skills throughout H1, making the campaign a huge success. Across all of Delivery, <b>971 leads were passed, 217 of which converted to visits, and 60 of which converted to units</b>. Crimson Delivery dominated the lead passing spectrum, finishing the campaign with a total of <b>449 OAB leads</b>. EAB Delivery soared above the visit competition with a <b>45% lead to visit conversion rate</b>, followed by Cost & Ops Delivery with a <b>22% lead to visit conversion rate</b>. Not to be forgotten, Rev Cycle Delivery brought in an impressive heap of NBB, finishing with the highest average lead value - <b>$6,121 per lead</b>! Check out an overview in the chart below.</p>
                
                <p>Thanks for tuning in each week for #TravelTuesday! Stay up to speed on The Daily Lead for the next OAB adventure. </p>

                <p><b class="bluetext">What do you do?</b></p>
                
                <p>I’m a CRM (customer relationship management) solution. Essentially, I am a digital marketing command center for marketing teams at hospitals and health systems. I help members make the transition from traditional advertising (think billboards and newspapers) to digital advertising (websites, social media, emails, etc.) much easier.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">Tell me more.</b></p>
                
                <p>I love what I do. I help members better understand who to target for services and how to target. I also calculate ROI from their marketing campaigns so they can see the impact of their advertising efforts.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">What is the one thing about you that you want me to know?</b></p>
                
                <p>I’m extremely supportive. Members will have a dedicated resource – an in-house digital marketing expert who can develop, optimize, and manage digital marketing campaigns much like an agency would.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">What do you do for fun?</b></p>
                
                <p>I enjoy yoga and long walks on the beach. I also like to help members take a more methodical approach to segmenting their target patient audiences so that they can better personalize their marketing strategy and messages. This is a win-win situation because patients will receive more relevant advertisements for their demographic.</p>

        		<h3><a name="Post76">What Do Playing "Chutes and Ladders" and Enrolling at a Community College Have in Common?</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark></mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Remember playing <i>Chutes and Ladders</i> as a kid? It has to be the most frustrating children’s game ever created! You could play forever and still never finish because every time you make a little progress, you land on one of those chutes and have to start all over. And then you feel like…</p>
                
                <iframe src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/24/af/aa/24afaa8ca18e11748e5b048bed2e5c60.jpg" width="480" height="216" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
                
                <p>Prospects trying to enroll at a community college often feel that same frustration. The onboarding process is actually more complex than most people think and, as you can see from the infographic below, it’s anything but a simple path.  In fact, trouble navigating the onboarding process causes 35% of students to drop out between applying to a school and the first day of class.</p>
                
                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/sscinfographic.jpg">
                
                <p>For example, a prospective student might find child care on-campus (ladder), but then miss a class registration deadline (chute).</p>
                
                <p>To experience this firsthand and try to identify the major pain points, EAB researchers took on student personas and went through the onboarding process at over 20 community colleges. It took them an average of 15 stops between student services offices to complete enrollment! For students on a college campus for the first time, this number could be even higher.</p>
                
                <p>EAB’s newest technology, the Student Success Collaborative-Navigate, aims to change that by streamlining the onboarding process and improving retention and graduation rates. Navigate is a student facing platform that creates customized pathways to graduation based on student’s interests, goals, and unique life circumstances.</p>
                
                <p><b>The four pillars of SSC-Navigate are:</b></p>
                
                	<ul class="bulletpointsindent">

                <h4><i><mark>#TravelTuesday</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Packing can be a hassle, whether you are packing for business or leisure. Check out these eight products and tricks to make the packing experience a little less dire.</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">1.	Purchase a <u><a class="bluelink" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bluesmart-world-s-first-smart-connected-carry-on#/story" target="blank">Bluesmart</a></u> Carry-On bag.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">It seems that these days you can control pretty much anything from your mobile device, so why not your suitcase? Using the Bluesmart app connected to your bag, you can lock it, unlock it, weigh it and track its location. It will even notify you if you are leaving it behind. Another perk? You can charge your phone 6 times over using its built-in battery. </p>
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">2.	Use toilet paper rolls to tame your wires.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">Packing all of your chargers and cables can be a pain, but unpacking them can be even worse when you discover they have coiled themselves into a tangled mess in transit. Wrap your cords up and stuff them inside an empty toilet paper roll to avoid disarray.</p>
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">3.	Invest in an <u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.studiobananathings.com/product/ostrich-pillow-light/?lang=en" target="blank">Ostrich pillow</a></u>.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">Okay, you will definitely look a little silly. But for those of you have value rest and relaxation over vanity, this “nap pillow” is extremely effective. Get the shut eye you need en route and arrive and your destination feeling sharp and restored!</p>
                
                <p><b class="bluetext">4.	Keep your shirt collars neat using your belts.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">It’s a simple and genius tip. The picture says it all.</p>
                	
                	<img class="indent" src="../img/blog/packingtip4.jpg">
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">5.	Splurge on a <u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2011/11/28/vacuum-packed-suitcase/" target="blank">Pumpack<a/></u>.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">For those who tend to over-pack, this luggage is a great investment. Vacuuming your clothes in airtight bags is a great way to save space and keep things secure, but it takes a lot of effort to utilize the method. That’s where the Pumpack swoops in and saves the day with its built in pump for easy, quick compression of clothing.</p>
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">6.	Put binder clips on your razor heads.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">This trick ensures that your razors pose no threat to the other items in your suitcase. It also keeps them clean!</p>
                	
                	<img class="indent" src="../img/blog/packingtip6.jpg">
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">7.	Keep your necklaces from getting tangled by threading them through straws.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">Every female knows the visceral frustration that comes with a tangled mess of jewelry chains. With this simple trick, you will never endure such strife again.</p>
                	
                	<img class="indent" src="../img/blog/packingtip7.jpg">
                	
                <p><b class="bluetext">8.	Store your shoes in a shower cap.</b></p>
                	
                	<p class="indent">Putting pairs of shoes in a shower cap keeps them orderly and un-scuffed in your suitcase. Plus, nice shoes remain clean and dry in the event that liquid toiletries spill in your bag.</p>

                		<p>Executive turnover is one of the most costly problems facing healthcare organizations today. Consulting &amp; Management’s (C&M) interim management service helps organizations temporarily fill vacancies by supplying interim executives that both hold the position until a replacement is found and drive towards strategic initiatives to achieve ROI while they’re there. The One Advisory Board team recently sat down with Andy Kellar, a Senior Director and interim executive at Mercy Health to learn about what it means to serve in such an important role.</p>
                	
                	</div>
                
                </div>
                
                <p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> Andy, what are your primary responsibilities as an interim executive?</p>
                
                <p><b>Andy Kellar:</b> C&amp;M engagements are typically sold in several phases: An assessment where we scope the member’s needs and make recommendations on how to address them, then development and ultimately an implementation phase where we partner with the member to implement those recommendations to move the Clinically Integrated Network and Population Health Services Organization to full operations. My role is to go in during the implementation phase to fill a vacant role at the organization for anywhere from 12-24 months. While I’m there, I work to take the strategy and recommendations from the assessment and turn those into tactics and operations. I then work myself out of a job by helping find a permanent replacement transition with my replacement and have a graceful exit! Then it’s on to the next engagement.</p>
                
                <p><b>OAB:</b> Wow! So being an interim is much more than simply filling a position and maintaining the status quo.</p>
                
                <p><b>AK:</b> Absolutely. Interims essentially play quarterback for the large number of initiatives the organization is partnering with C&amp;M to implement. This means overseeing a wide variety of initiatives such as network development, redesign of the care model, care management tools, infrastructure including IT solutions and staffing, finance and reporting, and payer strategy around value based care  strategy implementation, etc., all in addition to running the day to operations of the division I oversee. Ensuring all these efforts are coordinated, tracked, and produce results are all big parts of what I do.</p>
                
                <p><b>OAB:</b> This may seem like a silly question, but I moved to DC to take my job here at ABC. Do you have to move every time you take a new interim role?</p>
                
                <p><b>AK:</b> Haha no, but certainly spend a significant amount of time at the organizations I’m embedded in. Currently I work as an interim Executive Director of Operations at Mercy Health in Ohio. Generally on Monday mornings I fly out from Nashville where I live, work at the system office throughout the week, and then fly home Thursday evening. I usually do that three out of four weeks per month and when I’m not onsite, I’m working with the member remotely. </p>
                
                <p><b>OAB:</b> What do you like about being an interim executive versus a permanent one?</p>
                
                <p><b>AK:</b> That’s a great question. I and a lot of my interim colleagues have been offered the permanent job for the position we were filling several times, but thus far, I’ve turned those offers down. I like the variety that comes with working with different organizations. Even if the problems are often similar across organizations, working with new people each time to solve them is a unique challenge. In addition, I learn something from each engagement that carries over into the next one. </p>
                
                <p><b>OAB:</b> What’s a great way to identify an interim management lead?</p>
                
                <p><b>AK:</b> If you ever hear from a member about a current or upcoming vacancy they are trying to fill, email <b><u><a class="bluelink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com">One Advisory Board</a></u></b>. OAB will connect you with one of our C&amp;M marketers who can work with you to see if there is an opportunity for us to help.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>Raising Awareness for Surgical Costs</mark></i></h4>
                
                <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/orca1.jpg">
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">Orcas are one of the most organized, intelligent, and communicative species.</h6>
                
                <p>All that to say, <b>ORCA</b> really is an apt name for Massachusetts General Hospital’s ongoing campaign to raise awareness about surgical costs: the “<b>OR C</b>ost <b>A</b>wareness” campaign (ORCA).  Cute. And impressive.</p>
                
                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/orca2.jpg">
                
                <p>Indeed, MGH developed an organized process around sharing OR cost information, and established a common language through which they’re now able to effectively communicate this information to their surgeons – leading to seriously <i>killer</i> savings.</p>
                
                <p>So how did it go, you ask? And how can your members benefit from a similar program? Whale, let me tell you, it went very well. Swimmingly, you might say.</p>
                
                <p>With the help of Surgical Profitability Compass data and analytics, MGH drove overowhelmingly positive results through just minor shifts in product usage – to the tune of $500K in annualized savings. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. To learn more about their story, <b><u><a href="http://ns.advisory.com/Surgical-Profitability-Compass-OR-Cost-Awareness-Webconference" target="blank">join the MGH team on June 17th for a webconference</a></u></b> in which they’ll share more about ongoing efforts with ORCA – and how your members could drive savings with Surgical Profitability Compass too.</p>
                
                <br>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">Why should you care about OR Cost Awareness?</h6>
                	
                	<p>The OR is the profit center of any hospital, responsible for up to 40% of an organization’s revenue. However, it is also a cost center – and effectively managing cost is critical to establishing a market-leading surgical business. Duh, right? The problem is that managing cost within the OR is always easier said than done.</p>
                	
                	<img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/orca3.jpg">
                	
                	<p>When thinking about surgical supply cost in particular,  organizations often struggle to identify where their top opportunities for savings are.  Even more challenging is talking to surgeons about cost – and getting them to shift their firmly held beliefs and behaviors when it comes to the supplies they use.</p>
                	
                	<p>That’s where <b>Surgical Profitability Compass (SPC)</b> swims in. SPC provides hospitals with the data they need to efficiently identify cost variance, focus supply cost reduction efforts in the right places, and engage surgeons in meaningful cost conversations that lead to meaningful change.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>#TravelTuesday</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>The final round of the “Around the World” Campaign for PT DA’s is officially underway. At the end of June, one of ten finalists will be preparing to embark on a big adventure to Brazil, Italy, or Australia.</p>
                
                <p>In honor of our soon-to-be winner, here are six innovative companies that are revolutionizing convenient, safe, comfortable, and cheap travel. Whether you are a frequent business traveler or enjoy the occasional family weekender, these apps certainly have something to offer. Check them out!</p>
                
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.getflyr.com/" target="blank">FLYR</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>FLYR turns big data into big savings. A proprietary prediction engine based on billions of data points tells you exactly when and why airline prices will change, allowing travelers to “forecast” their airfare to determine the optimal time to purchase.</p>
                	
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.dufl.com/" target="blank">DUFL</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>This app could be an answer to the prayers of the frequent business traveler. DUFL sends you a large suitcase to pack with the clothes and necessities you typically need on the road, and you schedule a time for them to retrieve it. Packing experts at DUFL will then inventory, photograph, and clean all your clothes and store them. Before your next business trip, simply open up the app and tap, tap, tap through your virtual closet, selecting which items you’ll need. Enter your arrival date and location, and say goodbye to duffel-lugging and baggage claim—your bag will be waiting at your hotel¬. When it’s time to head home, simply repack the suitcase, schedule a pick up time in the app, and leave the bag at the hotel front desk. DUFL will dry clean and repack your clothing so it is ready to go for your next trip.</p>
                	
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.tensator.com/us/showroom/tensator-virtual-assistant.aspx" target="blank">Tensator</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>They’re polite, helpful, multi-lingual, and projected in HD… They are virtual hologram airline representatives. Tensator creates computerized airport employees with actual names and personas to answer passengers’ questions about everything from security to airport navigation. Washington Dulles is one of three airports currently “employing” these futuristic reps. It makes you wonder… could hologram doctors be next in healthcare?</p>
                	
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.weathersphere.com/" target="blank">Weathersphere</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>This is the Rolls Royce of weather apps. Yes, it can provide a forecast for any given location, but it also employs satellite radar and mathematical algorithms to help users navigate specifically around inclement weather. Your typical “40% chance of rain” iPhone forecast is put to shame by Weathersphere’s “nowcasting” technology, which can tell you the exact time that a storm will hit, and how long it will last.</p>
                	
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://bag2go.info/" target="blank">Bag2Go</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>Introducing “Smart luggage”! (All objects are bound to have “smart” versions sooner or later.) This suitcase is equipped with GPS and 2G mobile data capabilities so paranoid travelers can track their bag to make sure it gets on the flight. I will admit that having this technology seems like a moot point if the cabin doors have closed and your suitcase still won’t text you back… However, upon arrival to your destination, you’ll at least save the time you would have spent hopelessly watching the baggage claim carousel move around and around to no avail.</p>
                	
                <h6><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.loungebuddy.com/" target="blank">LoungeBuddy</a></u></h6>
                
                	<p>Have you ever wished you could access an exclusive airport lounge occasionally, but without becoming a “member”? Based on a few trip details, you can search this app for airport lounges that you can access for free, or one a one-time fee basis. This is your key to the perfect “airport oasis”!</p>

        		<h4><i><mark>OAB Catches up with David Felsenthal</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p>I’m sure all of you saw the OAB Chatter post last month announcing Advisory Board President David Felsenthal as the newest recipient of OAB Bronze status (I know all of you read Chatter daily!) One Advisory Board was fortunate last week to catch up with David and ask him a few questions about his experience with passing leads, and about his friendly rivalries on the executive team. Here’s what he had to say.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> Thanks for taking the time to speak with us! Tell us a bit about the lead that you passed. </p>
        		
        		<p><b>David Felsenthal:</b> I was talking with one of our board members (Leanne Zumwalt) about an issue she had at her company, DaVita (a Kidney disease and dialysis management company based in Denver, CO), and thought we could help with it.  They are trying to figure out how to expand their full risk provider business into new markets, but are having issues around access to data for clinical, cost and network purposes.  They need not only the data visibility but also expertise.  So I thought, “Crimson and our Consulting & Management services!”</p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> What do you think makes a great OAB lead?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>DF:</b> <b class="bluetext">Just listening to members and hearing what problems they need solved – you don’t need to worry about which of our products or services can help.</b>  OAB is great at figuring out the right person or group--whether the support comes from one of the member’s existing memberships with us or through a service or product they may not know about.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> One piece of advice for passing leads that go to visit for everyone?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>DF:</b> Do the introduction of the marketer to the prospect yourself.  You are doing the member a favor as you are trying to help them solve a problem.  Get credit for helping them, and know that our sales process ensures that even if they do not end up purchasing our solution they will learn valuable information that will help them solve it. That is why our members take our visits – because we are always teaching. <i>(OAB note: fantastic suggestion!)</i></p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> Give us a couple words about the value of OAB.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>DF:</b> It has changed the Advisory Board.  It allows members to find us when they have a problem rather than us always having to be lucky enough to find them at that exact moment with that exact offering.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> Any hint on what you plan on doing with the incentive money?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>DF:</b> Unfortunately, I’m not eligible for the incentive, so I have to get my enjoyment out of knowing that every year I do better than Scott Schirmeier at passing leads. <b class="bluetext">Making Scott frustrated is worth more than all the incentives in the world.</b></p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> What’s with the friendly rivalry with Scott? You think you will win?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>DF:</b> Scott and I created OAB together (along with Chelsea Andersen, who actually did all the work!).  Unfortunately, while Scott was a great thought partner in the exercise, he isn’t a great relationship person and doesn’t have those marketer instincts to understand when there is an opportunity in front of him. Fortunately, with my tutoring, he’s gotten better to the point where he had a 75% conversion <i>(OAB Note: Scott says 90%)</i> rate on bringing on charter advisors to the Academic Affairs Forum a few years ago.  Also, thanks to my time travel machine, I was able to go back in time to provide him some mentoring that allowed him to be our number one marketer in the mid-1990s. I’m incredibly proud of how I’ve molded that awkward young man into someone that has some commercial gifts…. Although strangely still not in OAB.</p>
        		
        		<p>There you have it from the man himself! Passing great leads is all about listening to the member and making the introduction. And if you see Scott around the office, tell him that David has laid down the gauntlet.</p>

        		<h4><i><mark>A Free Environmental Sustainability Toolkit for Hospitals</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p>Did you hear the good <u><a href="http://investors.advisory.com/file.aspx?IID=4226484&FID=29098366" target="blank">news</a></u>? Last month ABC released a free environmental sustainability toolkit for hospitals. The <b><u><a class="bluelink" href="http://www.advisory.com/community-impact/health-care-sustainability-initiative" target="blank">Health Care Sustainability Initiative</a></u></b> “offers a free body of resources that will help hospitals across the nation promote community health, increase employee and patient engagement, and save millions of dollars annually,” says Graham McLaughlin as reported in press release.</p>
        		
        		<p>Better yet, one of the highlights of the toolkit is an infographic detailing the low-hanging fruit for hospitals to become more sustainable(everyone loves a good infographic!). The infographic highlights opportunities in three categories: saving energy, optimizing purchasing, and reducing waste. Each opportunity is also rated as easy, easier, or easiest.</p>
        		
        		<p>If you’re looking to build a relationship with a hospital CEO, COO, or someone further down the food chain, point them in the direction of ABC’s newest (free!) resource. The infographic serves as a good primer, and the link can be found <u><a href="http://www.advisory.com/~/media/Advisory-com/Standard-Images/Resources/30080_CI Green IG_WEB.pdf" target="blank">here</a></u>. Encourage them to check out the suggested opportunities that could <b>save them as much as $15 billion</b> over the next ten years!</p>

        		<p>According to a new book titled The Blue Zones Solution by Dan Buettner, there are 5 locations in the world that hold the secret to longevity based on their high percentages of centenarians. Advancements in health care are a key factor in longer life span, but these fairly remote points on the globe have secrets to healthy aging that date back centuries.</p>

        			<p>In Okinawa, about 6.5 out of every 10,000 people live to be 100. In the entire United States, this number is only 1.73. What is their secret? Buettner cites factors such as the mild climate and laidback lifestyle, as well as “longevity foods” which include melons, shitake mushrooms, tofu, garlic, brown rice, and of course, green tea.</p>

        			<p>In Sardinia, the ratio of centenarian females to males is one to one. For the rest of the world, this ratio is five to one. A researcher discovered a unique correlation between “pastoralism” (i.e., “shepherding livestock from the mountains to the plains”) and living to 100. Though you likely won’t find an easy way to transition to a “shepherding lifestyle” in the U.S., you can incorporate things like goat’s milk and sheep’s cheese into your diet, both of which have been praised for their correlation to longevity among shepherds in Sardinia. Of course, Sardinians also maintain a physically active lifestyle out in the fresh air, and they also drink a moderate but consistent amount of red wine.</p>

        			<p>A large chunk of the population in Loma Linda follows a biblical lifestyle which shuns smoking, drinking and television. Their diet consists mainly of grains, fruits, nuts and vegetables, and they drink only water. However, it was found that the pesco-vegetarians in the community (those who maintained a vegetarian diet with one moderate serving of fish per day) lived longer than those following a vegan diet. The most prominent foods in this community include avocados, salmon, nuts, beans, oatmeal, whole wheat bread and soy milk – could be worse!</p>

        		<h4><i><mark>#TravelTuesday</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p>This week’s Travel Tuesday installment is dedicated to the power of language across cultures. More specifically, to the humor that ensues when obscure phrases and idioms are translated literally.</p>
        		
        		<p><b class="bluetext">Here is a list of 10 phrases from other languages with bizarre English translations.</b></p>
        		
        		<ol>
        			<li><b><i>“I haven’t swum here on the roux soup.”</i> (German)</b> </br> Translation: “I wasn’t born yesterday…”</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><b><i>“There is no cow on the ice.”</i> (Swedish)</b> <br> Translation: “There is no reason to panic.” (A cow on ice does in fact sound hazardous.)</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><b><i>To “give the pumpkin”</i> (Spanish)</b> <br> Translation: to “stand someone up.” (i.e., sometimes you may think you have a date but instead you end up with a pumpkin.)</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><b><i>A “squeezer of limes”</i> (Hindi)</b> <br> Translation: A “person who invites himself to something.” If you invite yourself to a party, you better come bearing limes!</li>
        			<br>
        			<li><b><i>An “ant milker”</i> (Arabic)</b> <br> Translation: “Someone who is a tightwad,” i.e. a wealthy, generous person who doesn’t like to share (although I have a lot of respect for anyone who can milk an ant.)</li>
        			<br>
					<li><b><i>To be “flat out like a lizard drinking”</i> (Australian)</b> <br> Translation: To be very, very busy. Perhaps lizards are slow drinkers…?</li>
					<br>
					<li><b><i>“A raisin in the sausage”</i> (Norwegian)</b> <br> Translation: a pleasant unexpected surprise from something that is already great (think “icing on the cake” for a slightly more sophisticated palette.)</li>
					<br>
					<li><b><i>“He’s ripping clouds with his nose.”</i> (Serbian)</b> <br> Translation: “He is very conceited”, perhaps a more extreme image for the phrase “he stuck up his nose.”</li>
					<br>
					<li><b><i>“She has long teeth.”</i> (French)</b> <br> Translation: “She is very ambitious.” (Be sure to include your tooth-length on your resume.)</li>
					<br>
					<li><b><i>To “pull old cows out of the ditch.”</i> (Dutch)</b> <br> Translation: to bring up an old story, topic or argument that would be better left forgotten – seems like a cross between “beating a dead horse” and “opening a can of worms.”</li>
        		</ol>

        		<h3><a name="Post60">A "Freaky" Perspective on Health Care</a></h3>
        		<h4></h4>
        		
        		<p>If you’re a fan of the Freakonmincs podcast hosted by Stephen J. Dubner, you’ll find two of the most recent podcasts especially interesting.</p>
        		
        		<p>The first of the two-part series is titled <u><a class="bluelink" href="http://freakonomics.com/2015/04/02/how-do-we-know-what-really-works-in-healthcare-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/" target="blank">“How do we really know what works in Healthcare?”</a></u> lays the ground work by explaining the importance of randomized controlled trials, and explains why this concept is so important for determining which health care policies work. Do visits to the ER increase or decrease when adults who previously didn’t have health care are suddenly given access to Medicaid? What is the impact of care coordinators? Take a listen for these answers.</p>
        		
        		<p>The second podcast, <u><a class="bluelink" href="http://freakonomics.com/2015/04/09/how-many-doctors-does-it-take-to-start-a-healthcare-revolution-a-new-freakonomics-radio-podcast/" target="blank">"How many doctors does it take to start a Healthcare revolution?”</a></u>, presents an interesting perspective on the health care industry, a lens that rounds out the typical perspective we use here at the Advisory Board. In this podcast, we find out what happens to patients with severe heart problems when nearly a third of all cardiologists in the United States attend a conference, how medical pedagogy bypassed the renaissance, and how the plethora of hospital-centered television dramas effects the audience’s perspective on modern health care.</p>
        		
        		<p>We recommend both of these podcasts for anyone on the road today, or looking for engaging content to listen to over lunch—let us know what you think!</p>

        		<p><i>If you’ve been tuning in recently to our blog, you know that we’ve been sharing probing questions to ask the CXOs. Previously we tackled questions for <u><a href="January-March.html#Post52" target="blank">CMOs</a></u>, and today we have a double doozy—CNOs and CIOs</p>
        		
				<p>Below each question, we link to our internal OAB one-pagers for the Advisory Board memberships, products, and services that best address these issues. While each question is framed broadly, staff are encouraged to alter the wording or structure of each question to fit the context of individual member interactions.</i></p>

				<h6 class="bluetext">Chief Nursing Officers:</h6>
				
				<p>One issue I’ve come across recently with different members is the challenges of frontline staff accountability and the innovative ways hospitals are approaching the accountability and productivity of frontline staff as well as addressing quality of care issues such as never-events.  I’m curious to know if you have tried anything innovative or outside the box in these areas?</p>
				
				<p class="bluetext"><u><a class="bluelink" href="../resources/research/td.html" target="blank">Talent Development</a></u></p>
				
				<p>I’m not sure if you are aware, but the Advisory Board has a mobile-based technology which, among other things, specializes in patient experience and satisfaction. Do you have any initiatives in place currently to improve HCAHPS scores? What is your biggest patient satisfaction issue?</p>

				<h6 class="bluetext">Chief Information Officers:</h6>
				
				<p>I’ve been asking all of my members about their ICD-10 preparedness efforts, particularly because most of the work falls to the IT department.  Are you confident you have the resources you need to push the necessary changes through?</p>
				
				<p class="bluetext"><u><a class="bluelink" href="../resources/revcycle/roc.html" target="blank">Revenue Optimization Compass</a></u>, <u><a class="bluelink" href="../resources/revcycle/icd10.html" target="blank">ICD-10 Compass</a></u>, <u><a class="bluelink" href="../resources/research/hcit.html" target="blank">Information Technology Strategy Council</a></u>, <u><a class="bluelink" href="../resources/revcycle/rcs.html" target="blank">Revenue Cycle Consulting</a></u></p>
				
				<p>As I’ve been discussing the impact of Healthcare Reform with my members, one topic that has repeatedly come up is Meaningful Use. Many of our members are struggling to understand the scope of the mandate, not to mention put an overarching compliance strategy in place.  How are you approaching meaningful use?</p>

        		<h3><a name="Post55">The Art of the Qualified Lead</a></h3>
        		<h4><i><mark>Passing Great Leads</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p>When it comes to passing great leads, the term “quality versus quantity” is exceptionally true. Of course, passing a high quantity of leads is always a good thing, but passing a high quantity of <b>qualified leads</b> is a <b><i>great</b></i> thing.</p>
        		
        		<h6><u>Qualified Lead FAQ:</u></h6>
        		
        		<p class="bluetext"><b>What is a qualified lead?</b></p>
        		
        		<p>A Qualified lead has an identifiable chance for success. Direct introductions are a great way to ensure the lead is qualified. If you’ve already connected with the marketer prior to passing the lead, or have teed them up for a conversation with your contact, let OAB know.</p>
        		
        		<p class="bluetext"><b>Why are qualified leads important? </b></p>
        		
        		<p>Qualified leads have 10% higher Lead/Visit Conversion Rates than unqualified leads. If you want your leads to turn into visits (and earn some extra cash), put in a little leg work and connect with the right marketer before you pass it to OAB.</p>
        		
        		<p class="bluetext"><b>How can I pass qualified leads?</b></p>
        		
        		<p>1. Find the right marketer in Salesforce.</p>
        		
        		<p>If you are passing a lead for a specific product, a simple way to make it “qualified” is to connect with the correct marketer. The easiest way to find this information is to visit the Salesforce page of the institution, and scroll down to the “institution team” where you will see a list of marketers who own that territory, and the specific products they sell.</p>
        		
        		<p>2. Email OAB before passing the lead. </p>
        		
        		<p>If you’ve checked the institution team in Salesforce and the territory tracker in Box and still can’t find your marketer, OAB can help. Email <u><a href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a></u> and let us know you’d like to connect with the right marketer prior to passing your lead.</p>

        		<p>After what seems like a million stops, starts, delays, and deals, the new ICD-10 coding system will finally launch for our members on October 1 of this year. This means a TON of new specificity making everything from reimbursement to quality of care just that much more accurate.</p>
        		
        		<p>But it also means some serious comedy. You see, to get to all that additional accuracy, the creators of ICD-10 had to include codes for some stuff that would be really funny if it ever ended up in a patient chart. </p>
        		
        		<p>So, for your afternoon amusement, here are ten of the most hilarious ICD-10 codes (in no particular order)…</p>

                <p><i>If you’ve been tuning in recently to our blog, you know that we’ve been sharing probing questions to ask the CXOs. Previously we tackled questions for <u><a href="#Post48">CEOs</a></u> and <u><a href="#Post50">CFOs</a></u> – our next installment will help you surface leads for CMOs.</p>

                <p>As you think about the physicians you are responsible for, would you say they were data driven?  In other words, if you were to present them with data pointing to individuals being outliers on quality or cost metrics or perhaps even data that shows the physician organization as a whole lags behind its national cohort, would they respond?</p>

                <p>Because we are discussing physician management, I’m interested to know more about compensations plans for your employed physicians.  Compensation has been a top of mind issue for many members, particularly as it relates to approaching bundled payments.</p>

                <p>You mentioned the importance of quality care earlier and one of the areas our research team has been focused on recently is the importance of preventative care, particularly for chronic patients.  Do you currently have processes in place to ensure patients follow care instructions and that PCP’s are proactively managing and reminding chronic patients?</p>

                <p>Getting physicians, both employed and affiliated, to get on-board with organizational initiatives and priorities is something several of the members are work with are struggling through.  Have you done engagement surveys of your physicians in the past?</p>

                <p>One question I’ve been asking all of my members is how are you feeling about your ICD-10 preparedness? While it looks as though the compliance deadline will be pushed back to provide some breathing room, the transition is still lurking.  I want to make sure every member is ready to code V91.07XA for burns sustained from water skis on fire because of the huge threat to reimbursement.</p>

                <p>Are point-of- service collections a priority for you?  What processes do you have in place to provide cost estimates to patients in advance of services such as imaging and out-patient procedures?</p>

                <p> As we are talking about revenue cycle priorities, I’m curious to know what your payer mix looks like.  How confident are you that you are getting the best reimbursement terms from your private payers?</p>

                <p>I’m not sure if you’ve seen the Advisory Board’s research on the financial outlook for U.S. hospitals over the next ten years but we are projected huge downward pressure on average hospital margins.  One way many of our members are looking to mitigate that pressure is through improved supply chain management.  Are you looking towards changing the way you manage your supply chain and approach supply cost reduction?</p>

                <h3><a name="Post49">How Sharon Ward Taught Marietta Memorial "To Fish"</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>OAB Lead Passer Highlight</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>You know that saying, “give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime”? That’s exactly what Consulting & Management (ABCM) Sr. Director Sharon Ward did for Marietta Memorial when she passed a lead for Advisory Board’s Surgery Compass last November.</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">The Background</h6>
                
                <p>By the end of 2014, ABCM had played a huge role in Marietta Memorial’s successful transition to becoming an efficient care provider well-positioned for growth. Sharon Ward played a significant role in that project by working to improve Marietta’s turnaround times, maximize capacity, and address a host of other issues. However, by last November, a significant portion of the engagement was finished and Sharon noticed that Marietta’s leadership team continued to call her back to pull the data they needed to drive new efficiencies.</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">How Sharon Passed the Lead</h6>
                
                <p>One day, Sharon was talking with the CFO and he mentioned that their margins needed improvement. Rather than continuing to simply bill Marietta more hours, Sharon suggested that the CFO look at Surgery Compass, an Advisory Board performance technology built to control rising costs, improve surgical brand and market alignment, and optimize capacity and access.</p>
                
                <p>Sharon passed a lead to OAB by emailing the situation to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a> and the OAB team worked with her to connect the CFO with Tim Jensen, a Sr. Director with Surgery Compass. A visit was set up and Marietta ended up signing a five-year contract worth over $100,000.</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">How It Helped Marietta</h6>
                
                <p>To Sharon’s pleasant surprise, she received a sizeable percentage of the NBB generated through OAB’s “finder’s-fee” program (currently available to all ABCM staff). While the money was exciting, she is most proud that Surgery Compass enabled Marietta’s team to accomplish the work for which they had previously relied on Sharon to complete. Armed with the new tool, Marietta significantly reduced its cost-per-case and physician variation. As Sharon put it: “I’m a nurse, which means I like to empower my clients to help themselves long term. Passing a lead for Surgery Compass helped do that.”</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">How You Can Pass A Lead</h6>

                <p>Accountable Care strategy is the biggest challenge facing many of our members and the Advisory Board has partnered with members just beginning to develop a strategic outline, those who have taken definitive steps toward improving quality and bundled services and those organizations who are aggressively pursuing FTC approval for Clinical Integration. How would you define your organizations approach to Accountable Care and what do you think are the biggest roadblocks to pursuing that approach?</p>

                <p>Given changing demographics (i.e. increase in Medicare patients) and rising ratio of medical vs. surgical volumes, many of our members are increasingly worried about margin pressure. Our most progressive members have looked to better understand the mechanics of referrals, particularly of profitable procedures, in their local market as way to protect their margins. How is your understanding of referral patterns in your area and what are you doing to influence physician referrals to your hospital?</p>

                <p>Regardless of Accountable Care strategy, the majority of our members are focused on physician employment and the related sub-set of challenges including physician compensation, practice management, and the buy-in of individual physicians into the larger organizational goals. How high on your priority list are physician employment issues and do any of the challenges I mentioned strike a chord for you?</p>

                <p>You mentioned earlier that you were facing some challenges with your revenue cycle management, would you mind going into more detail about those challenges? I ask because the Advisory Board works with members on a wide variety of challenges within the revenue cycle from point of services collections, reimbursement negotiations with private payers and compliance with government mandates such as ICD-10 and the RAC take backs.</p>

                <p>Recruiting, developing, and maintaining talent has been, and likely always will be, a crucial aspect of providing quality care, driving an efficient workforce, and ensuring solid governance for our members.  I’ve heard a broad range of approaches to these challenges and I would be interesting in learning more about how you approach your talent organization. When was the last time you conducted an engagement survey?  What steps do you take to help clinicians gain business acumen as they are promoted into managerial roles?</p>

                <h4><i><mark>Community Impact's Stories Worth Sharing</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>This past fall, gears turned at School without Walls @ Francis Stevens– figuratively and physically. ABC volunteers from NPD, PT, and eTech each mentored a group of 45 students through the Lego Mindstorm Program, which uses Lego Robotics to teach students about coding, technology and problem-solving.</p>
                
                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/buildingrobots.jpg">
                
                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/buildingrobots2.jpg">
                
                <p>The teams began the semester by focusing on a school problem the students wanted to solve, which turned out to be hallway crowd control. Guided by their ABC mentors, they brainstormed ways to combat the student traffic. Ben Neal, an eTech analyst, explained, “We walked them through the thought process of identifying a problem, brainstorming solutions, and acting on them through their project. They proposed making lanes for students, which was a lot of fun and worked really well.”</p>
                
                <p>For the second program phase, the eTech team worked with students to craft a robot and program it to complete an obstacle course. Some of the tasks the robots had to complete were kicking a ball into a goal, spinning 180 degrees, and turning around to avoid running into walls.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout the program, Advisory Board volunteers drew from their own personal experiences and professional skillsets to explain each task at hand and guide their mentees through the execution.</p>
            
                <p>Brian Wong, a Business Analyst and the Community Impact Lead for eTech, said the most impactful part of the process was seeing the transformation their mentorship had on students. “The first day we walked in, kids were throwing chairs at each other. By the end of the semester though, they were respectful, attentive and excited about what we were accomplishing together.”</p>
                
                <p>At the end of the semester, all the students gathered at the Advisory Board’s office to present what they had learned, test out their robots, and celebrate a semester of fun learning with their ABC mentors.</p>

                <h3><a name="Post43">Can You Talk Strategy?</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>How to Identify a Lost CEO - Part I</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>Check out the three questions OAB asked Strategy Consulting's new leader, Dr. Jim Bonnette, M.D. about how to talk to health care leaders about strategy.</p>
                
                <p>The Advisory Board’s new Strategy Consulting practice, led by Jim Bonnette, MD is arming healthcare organizations with roadmaps for long term success. Jim sat down with OAB to give his perspective on what Strategy Consulting is, how it fits within the Advisory Board and why ABC is better positioned than any other consulting firm to plan the future of today’s healthcare organizations. Read on to learn the first 3 of the top 10
questions Jim answered and how you can partner with him to drive value for your members:</p>

                <p><b>Join Jim live</b> on February 12 from Noon-1PM ET for “Ask Jim Anything” on Chatter! <b><u><a href="http://abctraining.advisory.com/default.aspx?CourseId=2dde8403-5e12-4605-84c9-0a9d59b9a789">Register here</a></u></b>.</p>
                
                <p class="bluetext"><b>OAB: What does the Strategy Consulting practice do?</b></p>
                
                <p><b>Jim Bonnette:</b> The strategy consulting practice crafts long term strategic roadmaps for organizations that help them succeed in both the short and long term. This lines up with the Advisory Board’s pivot  towards selling solutions because we’re looking at how we can holistically solve a member’s problems by pointing them in the right direction.</p>
                
                <p class="bluetext"><b>OAB: Are there common mistakes organizations make in strategic planning? </b></p>
                
                <p><b>JB:</b> A common mistake many make is failing to view their organization from an outside perspective when crafting their strategic plan. They don’t understand how the marketplace is going to force them to change over time.</p>
                
                    <p>I see this in the questions we routinely get from healthcare leaders like, “What is going to happen with retailers and the delivery of basic primary care? What is going to happen with private exchanges? What is going to happen as insurance goes predominantly individual?” It’s not just providers asking these questions.  Insurers and retailers are just as stumped.</p>
                    
                <p class="bluetext"><b>OAB: What questions can I ask that might indicate my member would benefit from speaking with your team?</b></p>
                
                <p><b>JB:</b> Broad questions work great like, “what is your strategy to relate to the
significant change in the way primary care is deployed? What is your relationship to retail delivery in primary care? What is your strategy for your relationship with your payers?”</p>

                    <p>Most orgs take the approach of - I’m going to do a little more of what I’ve done in the past, a little better - and that isn’t going to be enough in the new marketplace. Most are quite honest when they’re unsure about what they will do in the private exchange marketplace or with retailers like Walmart. These are the folks we can help.</p>

                <h3><a name="Post41">Why People Aren't Opening Your Emails</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>And How To Change It</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>This week’s blog post comes from our friends on the Digital Marketing team, who work on crafting and executing all marketing email campaign materials. Below, they’ll share tips on how to not only craft your next email, but how to get people to open and engage with your message.</p>
                
                <p>So, how do you make your emails interesting and effective?</p>
                
                <h6 class="bluetext">Step 1: The Subject Line</h6>
                
                    <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/effectiveemail1.jpg">
                    
                    <p></p>The subject line is your headline. Make sure it’s to the point. Convey your offer clearly. The subject line is like the gatekeeper of your email, so first and foremost, it should grab your attention.
                
                    <p>We can’t be quite as cheeky as JCrew in our own corporate emails, but depending on the tone of your company, something eye-catching can go a long way. Subject lines like “Only a Few Seats Left!” for an event registration email or “3 Things Your Competitors Learned” as a follow-up to an event the receiver didn’t attend are a few attention-grabbing ideas.</p>
                
                    <p><b>Personalize</b></p>
            
                    <p>Personalizing used to mean including the name of the recipient in your copy (Good morning, Bob!) but that no longer enough. The most effective way to personalize subject lines is to first segment your audience, and then craft the subject line to reflect their exact needs and problems. Do they seem to be frequently putting up blog posts? Email them your guide to crafting social media content with a subject line “Need more Twitter followers?”</p>
                
                    <p>The same approach can also apply to the body of your email. Below is an example where the marketer looked at the recipient’s social media page and crafted their message to reflect their current standing and how they could help.</p>
                
                    <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/effectiveemail2.jpg">
                    
                    <p>On the flip side, be careful to over-personalize the subject line to the point of being misleading. We’ve all received emails claiming to be from a company executive that are actually marketing ploys, and those don’t tend to win over readers.  </p>
                    
                    <p><b>Align Subject Line With the Email Copy: The C.U.R.V.E. Method</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Once the readers open the email, they want to get exactly what they were promised in the subject line. If they don’t get what they were promised, your click rates will plummet. The <u><a href="http://blog.eloqua.com/curve-email-2" target="blank">Curve method</a></u> was created by Alex Williams, after years of writing and testing subject lines. A good subject line must possess at least two of the five C.U.R.V.E. elements to connect with your audience. </p>
                    
                    <p>One of the two elements of your subject line almost always should be the “R” (relevance) or the “V” (value). The other three elements are: “C” - curiosity, “U”-urgency, and “E” - emotion. Always remember that you’re talking to other humans – write what you’d want to read!</p>
                    
                <h6 class="bluetext">Step 2: The Email Message</h6>
                
                    <p>Now that your audience has opened your email after you wrote a stellar subject line, how do you get them to click? Whether you are giving them something fun, sharing important news, or trying to solve a problem, here are few important steps you should follow:</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Be Brief</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Most recipients don’t have hours to spend reading emails. Be short and sweet and outline what your main points are. Subheadings, bullets or combination of both are always welcomed.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Establish Relevancy and Benefits</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Just like the “R” in the C.U.R.V.E method for subject lines, strive to create relevancy through personalization. Let the reader know why they are being emailed, remind them of a previous conversation you had and what you can do for them.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Use Actionable Language</b></p>
                    
                    <p>Including assertive words like “download,” “get,” “reserve,” “ask,” etc. show the reader exactly what they can do –or what we want them to do – after viewing your email. </p>
                    
                    <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/effectiveemail3.jpg">
                    
                    <p>It may seem silly, but sometimes emails contain so many bells and whistles that people can’t decipher the main point. Be sure to include an obvious call-to-action, such as a large, standout button or hyperlinked text in a color that doesn’t blend in with the rest of your copy. These things not only draw the eye of your reader, but also their clicks!</p>

                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/strangelaws.jpg">
                
                <p>Strange customs and cultural nuances in some places extend all the way to the top of their justice systems. Here is a list of bizarre laws from different parts of the world and the United States that actually exist. During your next adventure, be sure to keep tabs on the legal ramifications of your activities. (Or risk ending up in an episode of <u><a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/locked-up-abroad/">“Locked up Abroad”</a></u>!)</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>“Unjust vexation” is a serious crime in <b>the Philippines</b>, and it just as vague as it sounds. Think before you vex someone!</li>
                    <li>“Find a penny, pick it up” is a good tip to follow in <b>Thailand</b>, where it is Illegal to step on money. </li>
                    <li>You can’t walk and chew gum in <b>Singapore</b>, or chew gum at all for that matter. Chewing normal gum is a fine of $1,000, a second offense is $2,000, and if you’re caught a third time you are forced to clean a public area for a day.  </li>
                    <li>In <b>China</b> adult children are required by law to visit their parents “often”, and “attend to their spiritual needs”. This law was passed in 2013. </li>
                    <li><b>South Carolina</b> takes marriage quite seriously. The “No Mock Proposal” law forbids anyone above the age of 16-years-old from performing a marriage proposal if they do not mean it.</li>
                    <li>Men, bring your razors to <b>Iowa</b>, where it is illegal for a man with a mustache to kiss a woman in public.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Britain</b> it is illegal to “handle a salmon in suspicious circumstances.” I’m not sure what this means, but keep your hands in your pockets at the fish market! </li>
                    <li>In <b>Vermont</b>, a wife is required to have her husband’s permission in order to wear false teeth.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Britain</b>, royal bloodlines are taken very seriously, even with pets. You are forbidden to let your pet mate with any pet from the royal house. </li>
                    <li>In <b>Hong Kong</b>, it is a wife’s legal right to kill her husband if she catches him cheating. However, she must kill him with her bare hands.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Britain</b>, don’t drink and drive a cow! It is illegal to operate any sort of bovine while intoxicated.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Pennsylvania</b>, it is illegal to tie a dollar bill to a string on the ground and pull it away when someone tries to pick it up. This state certainly cares about protecting its pedestrians from small disappointments.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Turin, Italy</b>, dog owners are required by law to walk their dogs at least three times a day. (You might consider treating your pup to an Italian vacation!)</li>
                    <li>In <b>Victoria, Australia</b>, it is illegal to change a light bulb unless you’re a licensed electrician. Keep some flashlights on hand.</li>
                    <li>In <b>Switzerland</b>, it is illegal to flush a toilet after 10 pm. Tourists should plan accordingly. </li>
                    <li>In <b>Argentina</b>, nightclubs are required by law to play the same amount of tango music as all other forms of music combined. Good news for tourists seeking an authentic party experience!</li>
                    <li>In <b>France</b>, it is illegal to name a pig Napoleon. Apparently this is considered offensive to the great French general and emperor.</li>
                    <li>Though I’m not sure this law is followed, in <b>Milan, Italy</b>, citizens are required to smile at all times or risk a hefty fine. (You are exempt from this law when visiting hospitals and funerals.)</li>
                    <li><b>Finland</b> once banned Donald Duck comics because he never wore pants.</li>
                    <li>In <b>France</b>, selling an E.T doll is technically illegal. Apparently there is a law in existence that forbids the sale of any doll that does not have a human face.</li>
                    <li>Though I’m not sure how it is enforced, in <b>Portugal</b> it is illegal to urinate in the sea.  </li>
                    <li>In <b>Florida</b>, there is apparently a law that prohibits any unmarried woman from parachuting on a Sunday. (I would like to know the origin of this ban.)</li>
                    <li>On the </b>Isle of Capri</b>, it is illegal to wear noisy sandals in public. Be wary of flip-flops!</li>
                    <li>It is perfectly legal for citizens in <b>Belgium</b> to throw Brussels sprouts at tourists. (Be nice to the locals or brace yourself for this attack.)</li>
                    <li>Possibly the most tempting law to take advantage of: In <b>Danish</b> restaurants you are not required by law to pay for your meal unless you are "full" by your own opinion. So, if you are ever strapped for cash in Copenhagen, you can willingly conform to the gluttonous American stereotype and fight for your rights! </li>

                <h3><a name="Post39">Executive Transitions - The New "Lay Up" of Leads</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Don't Forget That Fundamentals Matter</mark></i></h4>
                
                <p>If you follow basketball, you already know that the UVA Men’s basketball team is having an incredible season – the Cavaliers are undefeated at 18-0 and are ranked #2 in the country. Dynamite players like Justin Anderson and Malcolm Brogdon are keys to success, but head coach Tony Bennett claims his team’s incredible run comes from their powerful fundamentals, including a strong defense, ball control, and humility.</p>
                
                <p>Those same principles can be applied to drive NBB. What do we know to be true about building our business? We know warm leads have better conversion rates, that CXOs are critical to closing business, and that our strongest asset is our ability to support and serve our members as thought-partners.</p>
                
                <p>So how do <b>executive transitions</b> fit in? We passed almost <b>500 ET leads</b> in 2014, yet the lead-to-visit conversion rate was a meager <b>10%</b>. To provide some background, Executive Transition leads are passed once we learn a member CXO has changed organizations. These leads are incredible for several reasons:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><b>It’s a CXO lead</b> – warm CXO leads should be the highest converting group of leads overall</li>
                    <li>We have intelligence on the contact before outreach, based on our past experience</li>
                    <li>We can, <i>and should,</i> position ourselves as a <b>thought partner for the executive</b> as they transition into a new role</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>On the flip-side, several teams saw incredible results by leveraging ET leads. One success story comes from <u><a href="http://www.advisory.com/solutions/spend-performance-solutions">Spend Performance Solutions</a></u>, part of Revenue Cycle, which focuses on margin management and reducing clinical supply spend. SPS had a <b>24% lead-to-conversion rate</b> for ET leads, and closed the largest unit from an ET Lead ever when they booked Community Health Network in Indiana for $250K.</p>
                
                <p>Success is possible if you go back to the basics: <b>prioritize</b> high-conversion ET leads, position yourself as a <b>thought partner</b> during a challenging time, and leverage <b>appropriate scripting</b>. Don’t stop practicing your layups quite yet, they might help you win the big “game”.</p>

                    <p>Watching Audrey Hepburn eat gelato on the Spanish Steps and whiz past the Trevi Fountain on the back of a Vespa is enough to have you shaking your piggy bank and counting your PTO days!

                    <p>Okay, so it’s probably wise to take a lesson from Christopher McCandless’ ultimately tragic fate if you are planning a wilderness adventure for yourself, but Jon Krakauer’s vivid descriptions of Alaskan nature are inspirational and thought-provoking. After watching the adapted movie, you’ll likely add Alaska to your destination bucket list based on the continuously beautiful landscape backdrop throughout the film. (There is also a slight chance you will download the Eddie Vedder soundtrack to your ipod and trek pensively around your backyard at the sight of the next snow flurry.)</p>

                    <p>Although this documentary is not specifically about travel, it provides a unique and inspiring mosaic of daily life in other cultures. The film documents one day, July 24, 2010, and is comprised of content from 80,000 YouTube submissions from people in 192 different countries. It is a beautiful movie to remind viewers that each seemingly insignificant day is indeed a monumental day in history. Better yet, you can watch it for free on YouTube!</p>

Vivid, sarcastic recounts from his experiences with different cultures are relatable and hilarious.

                <h4><i><mark>Try Betting Against Yourself</mark></i></h4>

                <p>Remember the famous marshmallow test that measured the self-control of preschoolers? In this short podcast, Walter Mischel of the marshmallow test tells you how his research in delayed gratification can help you keep your New Year’s resolution.</p>
                
                <p> It has a lot to do with mapping out a plan, not just setting a lofty goal. Being equipped with an answer before the temptation even arises can go a long way in setting you up for success, Mischel says.</p>
                
                <p>Think you need a little more incentive? Dean Karlan, a professor of economics at Yale University believes more in the stick than the carrot for these scenarios. He says you should bet against yourself in what he calls a “commitment contract”.</p>
                
                <p>You can check out his <u><a href="https://www.stickk.com/">popular website</a></u> and set the stakes for your 2015 goals, for example, if I don’t stop ordering soda when I eat out at restaurants this month I have to donate $100 to my least favorite political party.</p>

        					<p><b>About Vanessa:</b></p>
        				
        					<p>Vanessa Athis is a senior consultant with Advisory Board Consulting & Management, formerly known as Southwind. Vanessa started as a Dedicated Advisor with Payment Integrity Compass before making the transition to consulting Her journey represents a path that more and more employees at Advisory Board are starting to explore. But how exactly does one come to work in consulting for the Advisory Board?</p>
        			
        				</div>
        			
        			</div>
        		
        			<p>Vanessa recently sat down with One Advisory to discuss her journey to her current role and give some useful advice to others interested in taking a similar path. </p>
        			
        			<p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> What was your first position at the Advisory Board?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>Vanessa:</b> Two years ago I joined the Advisory Board as a Dedicated Advisor for Payment Integrity Compass (PIC). I worked in that role for fourteen months before moving over to Southwind consulting where I am today.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> When did you first realize you wanted to get into consulting?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> I first became interested in becoming a consultant when I was assigned a joint project at Bronx Lebanon with the Revenue Cycle Consulting team. Due to the complex nature of the engagement (we were implementing PIC while simultaneously restructuring their business office) I got the chance be on site with the member more frequently and get to know the people that worked there in a way I hadn’t with my other members. Since I liked the increased interaction and the Rev Cycle work the team was doing, I started having conversations with my manager about how I could work on more in depth projects like this.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> How do you first learn about Southwind?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> I first heard about Southwind by reaching out to one of their internal recruiters. After a few conversations and some of my own research, I discovered the Physician Services division which does practice operations and revenue cycle consulting for medical groups. Working as a consultant there matched up perfectly with my pre-ABC background at the Emory Clinic and as PIC DA. It also matched my interest in working on more in depth engagements with members. I applied for a consulting role last year and have been working as a senior consultant ever since.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> Are there any roles at ABC that can prepare you to become a consultant?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> I would definitely recommend becoming a DA, especially if you get to support a technology. That’s because being a DA teaches you how to use reporting which is key in consulting. It also teaches you what metrics are important to a member’s success. I look forward to recommending PIC and other ABC PT products to my future Southwind clients. Because of the reporting experience I got working as a PIC DA, I know what great results look like.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> What is your day to day like?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> I’m face to face with members every day unless it’s a travel day. What my day actually looks like really depends on the engagement I’m working on. As a new consultant, you often find yourself working with middle and front line level staff that can be very resistant to change. This means getting good a change management is huge.</p>
        		
        			<p>Currently, I’m  working with front desk staff and management of a medical practices and am constantly working to instill confidence in the policies we’re implementing by explaining exactly what’s happening at their practice, what their goals are, what the changes we’re making will do to help. It’s so satisfying to see the impact we get to make on a daily basis.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> What do you like about working at Southwind?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> Southwind is a close knit group which I’m thrilled to be a part of. Because we’re on the road with each other all the time, we develop strong bonds which can help when working on engagements. This is especially true at the beginning of engagements, where clients tend to see you as an outsider. It’s then that being able to lean on your fellow consultants is great.</p>
        			
        			<p><b>OAB:</b> If you were to give one piece of advice to debating if consulting is for them, what would it be?</p>
        			
        			<p><b>VA:</b> Figure out if you’re a people person. As a DA you don’t HAVE to be one because you don’t have to spend long amounts of time with people. But at Southwind you’re onsite all day and members pay a lot for your advice. You have to have your game face on, but the relationships you build are wonderful. You’re always dealing with new people and new challenges. You eventually get close enough to people that you learn from them just as much as you teach them. That’s what gets me excited to go to work every day.</p>

        		<h3><a name="Post27">OAB 201 Skills</a></h3>
        		<h4><i><mark>Active Listening Tips to Surface Member Intel</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p>The #1 question lead passers ask during OAB training sessions tends to be some iteration of <i>“but I’m not in Sales and my role isn’t commercial, so how do I pass leads?”</i></p> 
        		
        		<p>Late last year, I set out to answer this question for lead passers.  With the help of the Corporate Executive Board, I identified two active listening tactics. These tactics can be used alone or in tandem. <b>The goal is to surface member intel and service opportunities.</b> If the tactics help you identify a lead – all the better!</p>
        		
        		<br>
        		
        		<h6 class="bluetext">1. Leading with Quality Assurance</h6>
        		
        			<div class="indent">
        		
        				<p><b>What:</b> taking a QA approach with current members</p> 
        		
        				<p><b>Why:</b> Understanding how your member views ABC and their current membership services can help uncover service opportunities and help see ABC from the member’s point of view.  Plus, if you do want to pass a lead this tactic helps you introduce the new product in meaningful and impactful way.</p>	
        		
        				<p><b>How:</b> Ask questions! It is ok to talk about things other than your product or topic area.  It is also ok if you don’t have all the answers (gasp!... that’s what OAB is for).</p>
        		
        				<ul class="bulletpointsindent">
        					<li>How would you describe ABC to a colleague?</li>
        					<li>What membership services are most important to you in your role? Why?</li>
        					<li>How do you measure success of membership?</li>
        				</ul>
        			
        			</div>
        		
        		<br>
        		
        		<h6 class="bluetext">2. The Jobs and Outcomes Model</h6>
        		
        			<div class="indent">
        		
        				<p><b>What:</b> Jobs are defined as part of your member’s workflow that represent the tasks or activities members need or want accomplished.  Members eventually “hire” products to fulfill jobs, just like they would hire an additional member of their staff.  Each job has a clear outcome. Jobs are:</p>
        					<ul class="bulletpointsindent">
        						<li>Benefit focused</li>
        						<li>Member defined</li>
        						<li>Measurable</li>
        						<li>Product agnostic</li>
        						<li>Prescriptive and action oriented</li> 
        					</ul>
        				
        				<p><b>Why:</b> Having a conversation with your member through the Jobs and Outcomes model helps steer the conversation away from specific products toward solutions.</p>
        			
        				<p>Here’s an example:</p>
        			
        				<p><i>If you’re speaking to a member and they tell you that right no, their biggest priority is to focus on referrals in their market.  That’s the job they’re working on.  If you respond with something to the effect of “Crimson Market Advantage is a performance technology ABC offers that blah blah blah blah…” the member won’t understand. What they will understand is if you lose the ABC lingo and tell them how we can help them get to their desired outcome. Now you’ve got their attention.</i></p>
        			
        				<p><b>How:</b> You guessed it…ask questions!</p>
        					<ul class="bulletpointsindent">
        						<li>What would happen if you didn’t achieve your desired outcome?</li>
        						<li>If you had to rank the different project you’re working on right now, which would come first? Last?</li>
        						<li>If you found yourself with a day of zero meetings, what’s the first problem you’d set out to solve for the hospital/health system?</li>
        					</ul>
        					
        			</div>

        		<h4><i><mark>Applying Social Science to Better Serve Our Members and Motivate Each Other</i></mark></h4>
        		
        		<p><b>Is yoga a sport?</b></p> 
        		
        		<p>This is my favorite case study question highlighted in <i><u><a href="http://www.redassociates.com/moment-of-clarity-3/">The Moment of Clarity: Using the Human Sciences to Solve Your Toughest Business Problems</a></u></i> by Christian Madsbjerg and Mikkel Rasmussen. Posed by a major sporting goods company executive in the early 2000s, his company was losing market share for reasons he could not articulate.</p>
        		
        		<p>This question was a game changer because it challenged the core assumption the entire industry was operating under at the time: sports products are produced to help athletes win. If yoga was a sport, it meant consumers were now engaging in sports, not primarily for competition, but for enjoyment, health, and appearance. This was a massive shift in understanding the industry’s consumer base and by the 2012 over half the sporting goods market was made up of fitness apparel geared at noncompetitive “sports” like yoga and jogging (Lululemon anyone?).</p>
        		
        		<p><i>The Moment of Clarity</i> as an easy read that raises some interesting ideas about how we should approach problem solving when we find ourselves in a fog (defined by the book as a time where we know something is wrong, but can’t quite define what the problem is). Too often, it argues we get stuck in approaching such problems with traditional assumptions like that people are rational actors, tomorrow will look the same as today, and our hypotheses are objective and nonbiased. Problems this vague are better solved through the use of social science. Christian and Mikkel call this problem solving technique <i>sensemaking</i> and it posits that by studying the human experience of those we are trying to influence, we can gain insight that can set our business on clear pathway forward.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>How Can You Apply This to Your Role at ABC?</b></p>
        		
        		<p>When it comes to solving problems we face every day at ABC, this book has a lot to offer. In my own job, it has helped me rethink how I influence the team of MAs I work with daily. I realized I too often assume monetary incentives will drive my desired outcomes. If I need X visits by the end of the week, I’ll offer them each $100 if they hit that number. However, as soon as I started applying some of the sensemaking techniques, I gained a clearer understanding of what the experience of being a recent college grad in an intro sales job is like. This helped me realize that other methods can be equally, if not more effective motivators such as public recognition or unique opportunities for career pathing.</p>
        		
        		<p>Sensemaking can help us better understand our members as well. Rather than jumping to default thinking like, “more CNOs will buy this membership if I can find new way to bundle it”, take time to listen to what they say and, if possible, talk with someone about what their day to day is like. What is it <b>LIKE</b> being a leader of a team of nurses? What are their daily challenges? How do they fit into the larger context of a CNO’s life? If we can gain a better understand of our members through this process outlined in <i>The Moment of Clarity</i>, we’ll be in a much better position to serve their needs going forward. For that reason, I highly recommend checking it out.</p>

        		<p>We’ve all been there. Wouldn’t it be nice if there were a tool that would tell you how much you owe before your procedure?</p>
        		
        		<p>Lo and behold, there is! <b class="bluetext">Payment Navigation Compass</b> is a patient access workflow technology that helps hospitals and medical groups estimate a patient’s financial obligation, verify their insurance coverage, and obtain authorization.  </p>
        		
        		<p>With the increase of patient obligation caused by the new health exchange plans, and commercial payers shifting to higher deductible and co-insurance plans, organizations must redirect their focus to front-end operations to protect their margins. Payment Navigation Compass can help your members navigate this risky and evolving reimbursement landscape – read on to learn more.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>Q:</b> Why do our members select us?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>A:</b> Hands down, our service. Our team spends unlimited time onsite before and after implementation.  We’ll run a patient access diagnostic and readiness assessment to help enhance processes prior to implementing the technology, and we’ll educate staff on why this project is important, how to appropriately communicate with patients, and what exactly to say during collection.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>Q:</b> What types of people do we meet with?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>A:</b>We typically work directly with the Patient Access Director/Manager or the Business Office/Revenue Cycle Director. PayNav evaluations typically begin at the lower level and move up to the CFO. However, in smaller organizations they are very much involved.  Director of Managed Care can be a great advocate for the purchase of Payment Navigation Compass, as they are actively engaged in overseeing the system utilization by frontline staff. </p>
        		
        		<p><b>Q:</b> What should I ask to find out if my member could benefit from PayNav?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>A:</b> Here are some questions to get you started! </p>
        		
        			<ul class="bulletpointsindent">
        				<li>Do you collect at the point of service?</li>
        				<li>Do you have a system to help you estimate what a patient will owe?</li>
        				<li>Are you looking for estimation systems since it is so difficult to calculate what a patient owes now that it is based on co-insurance and deductible vs co-pay?</li>
        				<li>Is your authorization process overwhelming?</li>
        				<li>Is your eligibility verification process overwhelming?</li>

        		<h4></h4>
        		
        		<p>A video titled <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J67xJKpB6c">“If Air Travel Worked like Health Care”</a></u> humorously highlights the issues with unbundled services in the healthcare industry. The video follows a customer, Jonathan, as he tries to book his flight from DC to Eugene, Oregon. Unfortunately for Jonathan, he called AirHealthcare, the airline that works like the healthcare system.</p>
        		
        		<p>I definitely recommend watching the full skit, but if you don’t have time for that, then at least skip to the last minute when Jonathan gives AirHealthcare a piece of his mind.  He tears into them for not sharing passenger information between different airlines, for trying to reinvent the wheel at every stage, and for the whole process being ridiculously consumer unfriendly. No one would ever fly if the airline industry was like the health care industry.</p>
        		
        		<p>Well, one thing we can be sure of: Jonathan wishes he had been flying with Crimson Medical Referrals. The representative would have been able to book his whole flight in one fluid process.</p>

        		<h3><a name="Post21">Who Gets the Conference Room?</a></h3>
        		<h4><i><mark>One Advisory Proposes a Few Rules for Meeting Rooms</mark></i></h4>
        		
        		<p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> recently published an article titled <u><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/new-office-flashpoint-who-gets-the-conference-room-1413307377" target="_blank">“New Office Flashpoint: Who Gets the Conference Room?”</a></u>. Given the renovation of the DC office and then huge uptick of team and conference rooms, the article caught my eye. According to the article, upwards of 40% of employees waste up to 30 minutes per day looking for meeting space.</p>
        		
        		<p>I know those 30, very frustrating, minutes well.</p>
        		
        		<p>After I got over the fact that every meeting at Skull Candy—a Park City, Utah, maker of wireless headphones—seems to involve a case of PBR, I started to think about ways to improve the Advisory Board’s use of our limited conference rooms.</p>
        		
        		<h6 class="bluetext"><b>1. Transparency</b></h6>
        		
        			<p class="indent">All team rooms have dry erase markers. Use them to save your colleagues some time. When you enter a conference room (that isn’t on Meeting Room Manager), take 15 seconds to write when your meeting will be over on the window next to the door. If it’s 1:55 and I’m looking for a team room, I can’t tell if your meeting or call will be done at 2:00 or 2:30.  If I know it’s 2:00, I can wait until you’re done.  If it’s 2:30, I can continue my search.</p>
        		
        		<h6 class="bluetext"><b>2. Keep an Eye on the Clock</b></h6>
        		
        			<p class="indent">See those people milling around outside the conference room you reserved until 12:00?  Is it 12:04? You have overstayed your reservation and it’s time to let others have the room. I know that those last three minutes of your meeting are super important, which is exactly why the ball won’t get dropped if you finish the discussion in the hallway or over email. When you overstay your reservation, you create a domino effect of lateness. <u><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_theory" target="_blank">This is not Nam.</a></u> <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAhBa2zvAsY" target="_blank">There are rules.</a></u></p>
        			
        		<h6 class="bluetext"><b>3. Give Directions</b></h6>
        		
        			<p class="indent">Meeting with people from a different floor or a different office? Give them directions! It’s great that you walk by Heathrow, or NoMa, or Vermont every day but I have no idea where it is. How many times have you seen me <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfpKXa-AhPE" target="_blank">wandering around your floor looking for Danny?</a></u> Just give me a hint. “Take a left at the common room and it’s the first room on the right,” or “it’s two rooms down from the men’s bathroom.” Anything helps.</p>

        		<h4><i><mark>An Interview with Ford Koles</i></mark></h4>

                    <div class="bloggerbiotext">

                        <p><b>About Ford:</b></p>

                        <p>Ford Koles is the Executive Director of the Educational Services team and has been one of the most respected ABC experts on health care strategy and economics over his 22 years at the firm.</p>

                        <p>On August 22nd, Ford sat down with One Advisory to discuss “True North,” work/life balance, and his advice for younger staff looking to make an impact on members.</p>

                    </div>
        		
        		</div>
        		
        		<p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> What Does True North Mean to You?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>Ford Koles:</b> True North is the principle differentiator between us and anyone else.  Whether that be an association, a consulting firm, SG2, Epic, you name it. Why is our information better?  Because we hold ourselves to that higher standard: magnetic north vs. True North is the juxtaposition between common wisdom and true insight. Without True North, any best practice is just a cool and funky new idea.  Like the ice bucket challenge. Those things are new and fun but not part of any True North. What we do is anchor everything we do in a bigger picture. When I worked for consulting firms, what we wanted to do was find the hot new idea and that’s what we wanted to sell.  That was fun for a while, but stepping back I don’t know that what I was selling was all that impactful. True North, in that sense, is everything for me.  If I didn’t have that I think I would feel a lot more like a hamster in a wheel. </p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> When you’ve had a long week with a lot of travel or are feeling frustrated, how do you keep your compass set? </p>
        		
        		<p><b>FK:</b> I maintain a very good work life balance.  I never get down to zero.  I know that if I have a tough time on the home front, I have the Advisory Board.  The fact that I like my job and that a lot of people don’t like their job in the rest of the world, it helps balance me. And the opposite is true.  If I have a tough day or an executive is rude to me, then I go home and play with my kids.It works both ways and I think people forget that.</p>
        		
        		<p><b>OAB:</b> Any advice for staff earlier in their careers who are looking to make a difference for their members?</p>
        		
        		<p><b>FK:</b> It’s all about finding your gift.  David Bradley gave me the following four-part advice:</p>
        		
        			<ol>
        				<li>Ask yourself, when were you at your happiest?  What were you doing?</li>
        				<li>Don’t say you want to work in finance or healthcare.  Those are nouns.  Get to the verb. What’s the verb, not the noun?  What is it you want to do?  Do you want to sell? To renew? To manage?</li>
        				<li>You’re in an MBA project group and everyone is working to get a job done.  And you go around the table and look at the tasks and you say, “That’s the job I want to do,” and all your friends say, “That’s the job you should do.”  What is that thing?</li>
        				<li>Make sure your ladder is leaning up against the right building.  Everyone at ABC is so type A that if they see a ladder in front of them, they are going to climb their way to the top of it. Then you find yourself at the top of the ladder and wonder how you got up there. So make sure your ladder is leaning up against the right building before you start climbing.</li>
        			</ol>
        			
        		<p>In a day to day sense, I try really hard to be a good listener.  When you sit with a member executive, listen to them.  Really listen.  What’s the problem?  We spend way too much of our time with an agenda.  But I find I’m doing my best when I’m really listening.</p>

        		<p>Members asked—and we made it happen.  The unprecedented <b>Clinical Variation Analyzer</b> helps Crimson Continuum of Care members reduce clinical 
        		variation. We’ve normalized the CDM descriptions used by hundreds of our cohort hospitals to compare utilization rates of each physician against a 
        		national database of charges.  Members can now not only understand what their physicians are ordering, but also what other physicians across the country 
        		are using for similar patients—and how utilization impacts quality outcomes.</p>
        		
        		<p>Why is that so critical? Reducing variation in care is the most effective way to control costs and ensure that patients get the best quality care. CMOs 
        		and CFOs alike are working with physicians to get them onboard and make standardization a priority.</p>

        		<h3><a name="Post15">PIC-Forecaster</h3>
        		<h4><i><mark>Addressing Population Health Strategy In a Way Other Tools Can't</mark></i></h4>

        		<p>All of us at ABC believe in the value that we provide for members, but with the sheer volume of our
        		offerings, it’s not always the easiest thing in the world to connect a member with precisely what they
        		need. For example, a CFO says she’s focused on population health- great!  You may have wondered: do I
        		talk to her about HCAB, PHA, CPRM, or this thing called PIC-Forecaster?</p>

        		<p>PIC-Forecaster is a PT that addresses population health strategy in a way that other tools can’t. If
        		you remember one sentence from this blog post, remember this: <b>PIC-Forecaster enables members to
        		understand the <i>financial</i> impact of delivering value-based care and capitalize on their care
        		transformation efforts.</b></p>

        		<p>Everyone is focused on cutting costs and improving efficiency, but at the end of the day the result
        		is reduced volume. Without a way to monitor and predict financial performance while undergoing care
        		transformation, organizations could see their efforts “rewarded” with slashed revenues. For more
        		progressive organizations, PIC-Forecaster can also be used as a way to model and monitor risk-based
        		contracts.</p>

        		<p>Here comes the slightly confusing part: PIC-Forecaster and regular PIC (Payment Integrity Compass)
        		are two PTs that are often bundled together, but can stand alone. This post is primarily focused on
        		PIC-Forecaster, but PIC also drives a great deal of member value.  If a member is struggling with
        		getting paid by insurance companies, more specifically underpayments and denials, PIC is the answer. 
        		The reason the two are bundled is that, together, they are the solution to present and future payer
        		contracting challenges.</p>

        		<p><b>PIC-Forecaster leads- what to listen for:</b></p>

        		<ul class="bulletpointsindent"> 
        				<li>We’re thinking of entering into a risk contract with one of our
        			payers, but we’re not sure we have all of the information we need.</li> 
        				<li>We’ve been very focused
        			on improving efficiency, but I’m not sure what impact that will have on the bottom line.</li>
        				<li>We’re thinking about joining/building an ACO</li> 
        		</ul>

				<p><b>Guiding questions for PIC-Forecaster:</b></p>

				<ul class="bulletpointsindent"> 
					<li>Is your organization redesigning its care delivery to provide
					low-cost settings?</li> 
					<li>Are you able to evaluate the financial impact of these utilization
					changes?</li> <li>Have you developed any risk-based/value-based care contracts?</li> 
					<li>Are you reliant on your payers to provide financial analysis for proposed contract changes?</li>
				</ul>

                <h3><a name="Post13">The Mid-Cycle</h3>
                <h4><i><mark>The Final Frontier of Optimizing Revenue</mark></i></h4>

                <p>With the amount of pressure hospitals are under with the increase in value-based purchasing and the transition to ICD-10, the Revenue Cycle team has spent the last year trying to answer a difficult question: What is the biggest potential area of impact within the revenue cycle that will allow hospitals to fund these changes?</p>

                <p>Historically, revenue cycles have looked at back office operations – how quickly can we get paid what we’re owed? More recently, they’ve focused on the front end – how can we increase collections from patients as they present? But our research shows that the area we’ve begun to term the <b>“mid-cycle”</b> – the moment the physician begins to documents what happens in the operating room to the time a bill is coded and turned over for collection – has been the biggest inefficiency for the hospital revenue cycle in the last few years, and <b>is really the final frontier of optimizing revenue.</b></p>

                <p>…but what does it mean to optimize the rev cycle? It boils down to 3 things:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Getting paid every dollar that a hospital is owed for the services provided</li>
                    <li>Doing so as quickly and as efficiently as possible</li>
                    <li>Ensuring that no one ever takes it back</li>
                </ol>

                <p>And that’s where ROC comes in. ROC allows hospitals the get a complete picture of their documentation and coding performance. It shines a light on hospitals’ biggest opportunities so they can improve revenue capture, prevent take backs, and improve quality measures.</p>

                <p><b>So how can you tell when an organization could benefit from ROC? Start by asking these questions:</b></p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li>Do you have visibility into the performance of your mid-cycle?</li>
                    <li>Do you feel like you have the financial and revenue data in your mid-cycle to understand the areas in which you need to improve?</li>
                    <li>Do you feel like you know how to measure and get ROI from that group?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3><a name="Post11">Advisory Board <mark>Tradeshow Strategy</mark></a></h3>
                <h4></h4>

                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/tradeshow1.jpg" alt="Tradeshow Image">
                
                <img class="blogfloatimage" src="../img/blog/tradeshow2.jpg" alt="Tradeshow Booth Image">

                <p>I recently attended a tradeshow with over 230,000 square feet of exhibit space. As I walked through the aisles, carefully avoiding the magicians, I was surprised by how simple it was for me to decide which booths were worth stopping in and which I was happy to skip. I never made the decision based on the product or service the booth was promoting, as this wasn’t necessarily obvious at first glance, but rather the initial greeting I received from the booth staff and the overall look and feel of the booth. The Advisory Board has been exhibiting at tradeshows for six years now. It is important for us to have a strong presence at the major health care tradeshows, including HIMSS, AMGA, ASHHRA, SHSMD, and IHI, as many of our members frequent health care tradeshow floors.</p>

                <p>As a company we are working to improve our overall tradeshow presence in the following ways:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Maximize quality foot traffic by vetting attendee lists beforehand and reaching out with personal invitations to meet:</b> The tradeshow floor can be an overwhelming experience. When you schedule time for someone to come by your booth, you have created structure for them in an otherwise hectic day. It is also easier for us to understand the ROI of a specific show by tracking the outcome of these in-booth meetings. </li>
                    <li><b>Creating a consistent booth theme:</b> Our goal across the next 12 months is for our booth to have an overall brand, consistent with ABC’s firm values, that is immediately recognizable on a tradeshow floor. This shift in focus from product to firm will help generate onsite interest and produce quality leads. </li>
                    <li><b>Equipping our onsite staff to be our brand ambassadors and create meaningful connections with members and prospects:</b> Exhibiting is expensive, and we only get to be on the tradeshow floor for about 12 hours per show. The goal of a tradeshow floor interaction is not to close a sale; rather, it is to generate interest in our offerings and make a great first impression. It is important for all booth staff to understand how to maximize the precious time we have by greeting each attendee, assessing their needs, and setting up immediate next steps. </li>
                    <li><b>Improve the use of in-booth interactive technology:</b> We want to think beyond the standard demo stations we have in our tradeshow booth to technology that allows attendees to interact with our product offerings on their own.  Installing interactive kiosks is our next step in improving our overall tradeshow presence.</li>
                </ol>

                        <p>Rivka is a Senior Consultant with the Medical Group Strategy Council research team and has been with the Advisory Board for six and half years.  She lives and works in Washington, D.C.</p>

                        <p>Rivka is well known for her passion for food and cooking.  She is regularly interviewed by area media and maintains her popular blog: <u><a href="http://www.notderbypie.com/" target="_blank">Not Derby Pie</a></u>. You can also follow Rivka on Twitter @notderbypie.</p>

                    </div>

                </div>

                <p>One Advisory Board sat down with Rivka in July to learn more about her love of food and pick up some tips for cooking healthy, affordable meals, while juggling the demands of working at the Advisory Board.  Edited excerpts below.</p>

                <p><b>One Advisory Board:</b> Can you tell us a little bit about what got you interested in food and cooking?</p>

                <p><b>Rivka Friedman:</b>  I grew up watching my mom cook, and then standing on a stool next to her, and then helping her, and then at some point – I think in sixth grade –I said, “I would like to be in charge of all my own lunches.”  My parents were not great lunch makers, and I never enjoyed my lunch. So I just started making my own lunch, and that was the beginning of the end.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> Given how busy everybody is at the Advisory Board, it can be difficult to find time to cook, especially on week days, how do you find the time?</p>

                <p><b>RF:</b> Half my cooking is done on the weekend. Generally, I’ll roast two pans of vegetables, make a pot of grains, and then get some sort of cheese or other protein, and I’ll mix and match the elements across the week. So, one day I am eating wheatberries with eggplant and feta, another day I’m eating wheatberries with cucumber and soy dressing, a third day I’m eating rice with tomatoes and goat cheese, whatever it is.  The combinations are endless, and it’s an easy way to squeeze in homemade cooking when time is of the essence.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> Do you have any tips for shopping – places you often shop, what to look for in produce or meat, or how to find the best prices?</p>

                <p><b>RF:</b> I love the <u><a href="http://freshfarmmarkets.org/farmers_markets/markets/foggy_bottom.php" target="_blank">Foggy Bottom Farmer’s Market</a></u>.  It’s on Wednesday’s, from 3-7, so it’s perfectly timed for the end of the work day.  My other big tip for getting good food at low cost is to look for “seconds.” My favorite tomato grower at the <u><a href="http://freshfarmmarkets.org/farmers_markets/markets/dupont_circle.php" target="_blank">Dupont Farmer’s Market</a></u> on Sundays is named <u><a href="http://freshfarmmarkets.org/farmers_markets/meet_our_farmers_producers.php" target="_blank">Toigo</a></u>, and they have fantastic tomatoes that are like $4 a pound – not cheap – but they have a secret little crate underneath the table that has the misshapen ones, the ones with maybe a soft spot, and those are like 99 cents a pound, which is cheaper than the grocery  store.  They’re great for tomato sauce or great for gazpacho – and many farmers also offer second peaches and plums, too, so “seconds” are the way to go.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> What are three culinary skills everyone young professional should master?</p>

                <p><b>RF:</b> 1) How to use a knife.  I think people think a blunt knife is good because it won’t cut you as hard.  But actually, a sharp knife is good because it won’t slip. There are a lot of great knife skills classes in the area that will make you feel more confident when you cut. </p>

                <p class="indent">2) How to make an egg!  An egg goes on everything.  I think people under utilize the “put an egg on it” mentality for dinner.  Learn how to make it consistently every time and you can pretty much put it on whatever’s in your fridge and have dinner.</p>

                <p class="indent">3) I think people focus a lot on how to prepare a good cut of meat. I would put my own dollars and time and energy into how to make a perfect pan of vegetables...getting really good at cooking vegetables will make what you eat cheaper and more delicious.</p>

                <p><b>OAB:</b> What are your favorite resources for recipes, inspiration, and advice?</p>

                <p><b>RF:</b> If you’re looking for a book to read, I highly recommend <i><u><a href="http://www.amazon.com/An-Everlasting-Meal-Cooking-Economy/dp/1439181888" target="_blank">An Everlasting Meal</a></u></i>, by Tamar Adler.  A lot of the tips I shared are actually things she recommends in that book. In terms of blogs, I obviously have my own blog, but I would recommend <u><a href="http://food52.com/" target="_blank">Food 52</a></u>. It is a curated, crowd sourced website. So, it’s not just the Yelp of recipes, it’s the Yelp but then there are editors behind the site who are choosing “this one’s worth making, this one maybe isn’t worth making.” And so the cream rises to the top on Food 52, great resource.</p>

                <h3><a name="Post7">Before, During, and After - Part II</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>The Timeline of an OAB-Approved Member Interaction</mark></i></h4>

                    <p>Last week, we delved into tactics to use in advance of a member interaction help surface OAB leads.  For a refresher on the previous post, <u><a href="#New4">click here</a></u>.  This week’s post will look at what you can do during the member meeting and what to do after you’ve found a lead to pass.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h4><mark><u>DURING:</u></mark></h4>

                    <p><b>Keep the member at the center</b> – this tenant grounds everything we do here at the Advisory Board and it is within this vein that OAB was created.</p>

                        <ul class="bulletpoints">
                            <li><b>BE AN EXPERT ON ABC</b> - offer yourself to the member as a resource for all things ABC.  Even if you aren’t sure of the answer, you can connect them with someone who will be able to help.</li>
                            <li><b>ASK QUESTIONS</b> - whether it is specific business questions or general conversation starters (“What else are you working on?”) don’t be afraid to ask questions.  Trust us; you won’t look like you don’t know what you’re talking about.  Instead, you’ll look like you’re interested in the member’s work even if it doesn’t involve your topic area.</li>
                            <li><b>COVER THE BASICS</b> - it may seem silly, but don’t assume your member is signed up for advisory.com or the Daily Briefing.  A little bit of service can go a long way.  Make sure they know they have access to advisory.com and are comfortable using it.  If not, offer to set them up with a website walkthrough or tell them they can come to you with questions.</li>
                            <li><b>OUTLINE CLEAR FOLLOW-UP</b> - when you’ve uncovered a lead, tell the contact that a colleague will follow-up to provide more details.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <br>

                    <h4><mark><u>AFTER:</u></mark></h4>

                    <p><b>Teamwork is fun! (And also really helpful)</b> – don’t let your members needs get lost in the shuffle.  When you’ve uncovered a lead, you’ve also uncovered a way that ABC can continue to help this hospital or contact solve a problem they would otherwise be unable to fix.</p>

                        <ul class="bulletpoints">
                            <li><b>SEND THE LEAD</b> - may seem like a no-brainer and you may have the best intentions as soon as you get off the phone with your mem…<i>DID YOU GUYS HEAR THE FOOD TRUCKS ARE OUTSIDE?!? :: 15 minutes later :: Man, this enchilada is delicious.  Wasn’t I supposed to be doing something right now?</i></li>
                            <li><b>BE DIRECT</b> - this is your lead, make sure you outline clear next steps for the marketing teams to follow-up on.  Make sure follow-up reflects the expectations you set for the member.</li>
                            <li><b>RELISH IN YOUR NOTE TAKING ABILITIES</b> - include all your notes in the lead email to OAB.  Every detail can be helpful for the marketing pursuit.</li>
                            <li><b>SHARE THE (member) LOVE</b> - introduce your member to the appropriate marketer.  Introductions will make your lead 10% more likely to result in a visit.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>Regardless of your OAB lead passing prowess, these tips can help center your purpose and goal of a member interaction.  Keep checking back for more updates and advice on how to surface OAB leads.</p>

                    <p>Happy lead passing!</p>

                    <p>Everybody's talking about the rise of consumerism in health care. Marketing and Planning Leadership Council experts are telling us that "convenience is king," Health Care Advisory Board is telling us that a "retail revolution is under way," Crimson Market Advantage and Crimson Medical Referrals are asking "whether your physician network is set up to meet the new demands of your patients."</p>

                    <p>We live in a consumer driven culture.  We shop online for everything from clothing to groceries to flights. We can even buy health care online now.  We expect Amazon-quality service for every online purchase.  This doesn’t change when we become patients – we are still consumers at our core.</p>

                <p>While we may give out crazy prizes (hellooo Key West and Madrid) and look for any excuse to make a Biggie Smalls reference in an email chain, at its core OAB is all about our members.</p>

                <p>For some of you, passing an OAB lead may be second nature.  For others, you may be on the verge of passing your first lead.  Regardless, it’s crucial to pause every now and again and remind yourself of the timeline of a great lead.</p>

                <p>In a series of 2 blog posts, we’ll explore the BEFORE, DURING, and AFTER of an OAB-approved member interaction.</p>

                <br>

                <h4><mark><u>BEFORE:</u></mark></h4>


                <p><b>Knowledge is power</b> - did you know that the top passer has an average of 23 unique products in their arsenal? As the company continues to grow and invest in cutting edge technology, it may feel difficult to keep tabs on all of the products we now offer.</p>

                <p>A few helpful tips in understanding the ABC terrain:</p>

                    <ul class="bulletpoints">
                        <li><b>ADVISORY.COM IT </b> – make sure you’re signed up for access to advisory.com through your work email.</li>
                        <li><b>READ</b> – our Experts offer a variety of great content that can easily be read on your commute in or in between meetings.  Once you’re logged in, sign up for the Daily Briefing, blog alerts, and product updates.  You can sign up <a href="http://www.advisory.com/members/subscriptions" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                        <li><b>CONNECT WITH OAB</b> – this is what we are here for.  Really.  Think of the OAB team as your RMs – if you aren’t sure about what resources are available or how to use them, we’ll help guide the way.  We have a large <a href="https://advisory.app.box.com/files/0/f/1905060771/Public_-_Product_Overview_Resources" target="_blank">library of product resources</a> that are a great starting point to learn more about a given program or topic area.  If you’d like to walk through opportunities in your world, we’re always happy to do more in-depth, customized check-ins with you.</li>
                        <li><b>LEARN</b> – the Training and Development team is constantly adding new product trainings to the curriculum.  Be sure to read their monthly updates on new course and sign up <a href="http://abctraining.advisory.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
                        <li><b>SOCIALIZE</b> – riding the elevator?  Participating in a Community Impact event? Scarfing down FroYo in the Café? All of these are great opportunities to meet new people across the firm and learn more about what members and products they serve.</li>
                    </ul>

                <br>

                <p><b>Prepare, prepare, prepare</b> – even if the member you’re about to hop on the phone with is your BFF, don’t underestimate the benefit of a solid 5 minutes of prep before the meeting.  You never know when an opportunity could arise!</p>

                    <ul class="bulletpoints">
                        <li><b>RESEARCH</b> – use your best friend (or arch nemesis, depending on the day), Salesforce, to review the organization’s memberships and open evaluations before you start the conversation.</li>
                        <li><b>REVIEW</b> – remember those awesome, totally detailed notes you took last time you spoke to your member BFF?  Make sure to skim them before jumping on the call.</li>
                        <li><b>AGENDASIZE</b> – ok, so that’s not a word but how applicable would it be if it was?  Make sure you’re adding OAB as an agenda item for every member interaction.  Don’t be afraid to ask your member about what other project they’re working on, areas where they could use some help, or what their top of mind issues are.  You never know how we’ll be able to help until you ask.</li>
                    </ul>

                <br>

                <p>When you combine these tactics you’ll go into every member interaction feeling prepared to represent the Advisory Board across all facets, not just your product.  Check back next week for Part 2 of the post to learn more tips about how to surface OAB leads during and interaction and to ensure follow-up on your lead.</p>

                        <p>Do you believe you can fly? If your inner R. Kelly shouts “Yes!” then grab a few friends and head to the Trapeze School in Navy Yard. If you don’t have the urge to spread your wings and fly away, you can sign up for one of their other classes (trampoline, juggling, balancing &amp; acrobatics, and something called lyra). They also host team building workshops, so feel free to recommend them for you next team outing!</p>

                <h3><a name="Post2">Southwind Patient Access</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>[pey-shuh nt ak-ses]</mark></i></h4>

                    <p>The average wait time for a doctor’s appointment is nearly three weeks, which is driving many patients toward alternative options such as retail clinics and urgent care centers.</p>

                    <p>Our research suggests that <b>patient access</b> — that is, the ability to deliver care quickly in the right setting with the right provider—is <b>one of the most important factors</b> influencing consumers’ choice of where they receive care. It will be critical to protecting and growing market share over time.  In fact, we’ve found that the average organization has the ability to attract <b>at least 10% more consumers</b> by improving practice performance for better patient access.</p>

                    <p>Southwind routinely helps health care organizations design an effective patient access strategy. You can learn more about Southwind Patient access by: </p>

                <h3><a name="Post1">Best Practices for <mark>Learning about ABC's Products</mark></a></h3>

                <br>

                    <p>I’m often asked how I’m able to keep track of all of ABC’s products and services and the issues they address.  Truthfully, the answer is that it’s difficult.  However, if you keep a few broad principles in mind and leverages existing resources, you can improve your product knowledge in what amounts to a few minutes a week.</p>

                    <p>First, let’s start with the broad principles:</p>

                        <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                            <li>Focus on the products that are related to the topics you most often discuss with members.  For instance, if you work with physicians, you probably don’t need to know much about the Nursing Executive Center.  Try to focus on the 3-5 products that are most closely related to your work.</li>
                            <li>earn from your peers!  Ask someone who works on a different product to explain the value proposition to you.</li>
                            <li>Speak up. If you have questions about a product, the rest of your team probably does as well.  OAB can help organize education sessions for your team.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p>As for resources to help you learn about products and services – new and old – here are some of my favorite:</p>

                        <ul class="bulletpointsindent">
                            <li><u><a href="http://abctraining.advisory.com/" target="_blank">ABC Training and Development</a></u>: The T&amp;D team does a great job building a curriculum.  As of my writing of this post, there are 12 upcoming product education sessions in the next month alone.  Try to attend just one a month and you’ll be an expert in no time.</li>
                            <li><u><a href="http://www.advisory.com" target="_blank">Advisory.com</a></u>: You can search for any term and then click on the “Products &amp; Services” tab and advisory.com will give you a list of products that map to that term.</li>
                            <li><u><a href="../resources/leadpassing.html" target="_blank">The OAB Website</a></u>:The resources page on OAB’s portal gives a brief description of each product and links to more in-depth overviews on box.com.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <p><b>While being familiar with ABC’s product offerings can help you identify lead opportunities, remember: you don’t have to know what product maps to a specific issue.  If a member has a challenge, send us the details and we can do the product mapping for you.</b></p>
