                <h10 class="bluetext">Wonder what all the fuss about ‘Stanson’ is about?</h10>

                <p>On August 4th at 1pm ET, Mike Murray will discuss how some organizations are taking a dive into over $700 billion left on the table in care variation opportunity.</p>

                <p>As the industry makes headway on digitizing clinical records, attention is now turning to unlocking the data inside the electronic health record (EHR) to advance strategic goals such as cost reduction, quality improvement, and risk-based payment preparedness. Some hospitals and health systems are taking the lead in leveraging this data by hardwiring clinical guidance into the EHR through patient-specific clinical decision support.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>PICPro takes the Broadway stage</mark></i></h4>

                <div class="leadpassersection clearfix">

                    <img class="hcabpic" src="http://i.giphy.com/Fwhzcum5O2RKo.gif">

                    <p>If any of you are like me, you’ve spent the last several months being completely entranced by the Broadway juggernaut, phenomenon known as Hamilton. With the soundtrack on constant repeat on my Spotify, I pretty much oscillate between which song is my favorite on any given week. This week’s obsession—“The Room Where It Happens,” the show-stopping number that finds Aaron Burr (originated by the talented Leslie Odom Jr.) lamenting his exclusion from a small, private dinner between three of our Founding Fathers that ultimately leads to the creation of our American financial system.</p>

                    <p>Often times, we take for granted the large impact that small opportunities can have on a systematic level. For instance, take professional billing collections and reimbursement challenges facing medical groups across the country. Traditional approaches to collecting small-dollar discrepancies from professional billing are costly, and often result in millions of dollars of lost revenue for medical groups due to unclaimed small-dollar underpayments and denials.</p>

                </div>

                <h5 class="bluetext">So how do we help members enter The Room Where (the small collections) Happen?</h5>

                <div class="citysection clearfix">

                    <div class="bettext">

                    <ul>
                    PICPro is helping our members reclaim these lost dollars and improve professional revenue. Our technology platform helps members maximize their contract yield by:
                    <br><br>
                    <b><li class="indent">Accurately calculating expected payment</li>
                    <li class="indent">Automatically surfacing and appealing denials and underpayments</li>    
                    <li class="indent">Modeling proposed and existing contracts to evaluate profitability</li></b>    
                    </ul>

                     </div>

                <img class="betpic" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-S4CXQPR8qak/Vql4ra02cGI/AAAAAAAAFf4/02cDO2RYxnU/s1600/intherooooooooom.gif">

                </div>

                <p>In other words, our technology is helping medical groups root out and appeal small-dollar underpayments and denials that, collectively, can amount to millions of dollars in recovered revenue. Talk about “Not throwing away my shot!”</p>

                <p>The next time you talk to your medical group members, ask them about how well they are equipped to tackle small dollar variances in their overall revenue recovery strategy. After all, we wouldn’t want our members feeling like Aaron Burr—missing out on small opportunities that can ultimately lead to huge financial gains.</p>

And it’s realizing the vision of how we are trying to evolve as a firm - bringing consulting (with retainer tail!) and our powerful technology platform together.

Needless to say, you all absolutely WOWED not only Kim, but the entire OAB Team. </p>

In case you missed all of your friend selfies, <a class="bluelink" href="http://dcist.com/2015/07/the_beach.php">“The Beach”</a> was a huge hit. But, this summer the Museum is getting even cooler (pun intended). Across July 2nd-September 5th, the Great Hall will be filled with giant icebergs as large as 56 feet tall. Although we’re sad to report that they’re not made of real ice, these icebergs were designed by the firm behind New York’s High Line, and we’re sure that they will not disappoint!</p>

                <h4><i><mark>Fun opportunities to serve your community this summer</mark></i></h4>

                <p>It’s no secret that the Advisory Board is invested in Community Impact. This past year alone, ABC employees completed more than 75,500 hours of service (this is NOT a typo…I repeat…this is NOT a typo). I don’t know about you all, but the OAB Team thought that that was a pretty inspiring number. So, over the past 6 months, we’ve invested some time into figuring out more ways to do our part. Take a look below to see what organizations we’ve been partnering with!</p>

                <br>

                <h10 class="bluetext"><b><u>DC Central Kitchen</u></b></h10>

                <p><a class="bluelink" href="http://dccentralkitchen.org/">DC Central Kitchen</a> is a community kitchen located in North West DC, and let me tell you, it’s an amazing place. Not only has Obama (and more importantly, OAB) volunteered there, but each day, volunteers and DC Central Kitchen staff help to produce 5,000 meals using 3,000 pounds of food. These meals are then distributed to nearby homeless shelters, transitional homes, schools, and nonprofit organizations. But…that’s not all! DC Central Kitchen also has a program that trains unemployed adults for culinary careers. Impressive, we know.</p>

                <img class="borderphoto" src="https://www.dccentralkitchen.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/WEB1.jpg">

                    <br>

                    <img class="hcabpic" src="../img/blog/seanbeardnet.jpg"> 

                    <p>DC Central Kitchen’s most popular volunteer opportunity is their meal preparation shift, a three hour shift consisting of basic food preparation (Ex. chopping, peeling, or washing food—perfect for you Top Chef wannabes). But, these shifts fill up fast! So sign up early on their <a class="bluelink" href="http://dccentralkitchen.volunteerhub.com/Events/Index">online volunteer portal</a>!</p>

                    <br><p><b>BONUS:</b> you may get to see your boss wear a "beard net" - yes, that’s a thing. (Photo proof on the left.) </p><br>

                    <p>In the summer, DC Central Kitchen also offers offsite Gleaning opportunities. Don’t worry, I didn’t just miss-spell “cleaning”, Gleaning is a real thing, and a very awesome volunteer opportunity.</p>

                    <p>During a Gleaning shift, volunteers visit local farms and collect leftover crops that the farmers aren’t able to sell. This produce is then used during DC Central Kitchen’s meal prep shifts.</p>

                <br><br><br>

                <h10 class="bluetext"><b><u>The National Arboretum</u></b></h10>

                    <p>With more than 446 acres of open fields, trails, and gardens, the <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.usna.usda.gov/">National Arboretum</a> is the perfect place to volunteer if you want to escape the city for an afternoon. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at the picture of our last volunteer shift below. You’re feeling calmer just looking at it, aren’t you? </p>
                    
                    <img class="borderphoto" src="../img/blog/arboretum.jpg">

                    <p><br>The Arboretum has more than 100 volunteers that they work with on a reoccurring basis each year, but they also welcome groups for one time and reoccurring opportunities! Volunteer groups assist with invasive species removal, weeding, mulching, and litter pick up. Workdays are scheduled for a minimum of 3 hours and a maximum of 6 hours (but, we’ll admit…the three hour shift was pretty tiring).</p>

                <h10 class="bluetext"><b><u><br>EveryBody Wins! DC</u></b></h10>

                <p>Once a week during the School Year, a couple of our OAB team members (and even more from our larger Strat Marketing family) pick up some of their favorite childhood books and read with students through a program called <a class="bluelink" href="http://www.everybodywinsdc.org/ourstory.php">Everybody Wins! DC</a>.</p>

                <p>Everybody Wins! is a non-profit organization devoted to promoting children’s literacy. The U.S Senate helped to launch this lunchtime reading program back in 1995, and the program now operates in 37 low-income public elementary schools across DC.</p>

                <p>Once, while volunteering with my mentee she told me, “I love reading! You get to travel places without having to go anywhere!”. If that doesn’t make you want to start volunteering, I don’t know what will!</p>

However, this month, Dan deserves a little extra recognition for his lead passing skills. Here’s why: recently, Dan stepped out of his typical role to help fill in for an Executive Advisor that left the firm.

As it turns out, Michael had worked with EAB while he was the VP of Academic Affairs at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry and he had REALLY enjoyed EAB’s work (Great work, EAB!!). Now, Michael serves as the VP of Academic Affairs at the Culinary Institute of America. While a Culinary Institute is not our typical EAB member, OAB was still able to loop in the Community College Forum Marketer (who was already having conversations with a Culinary Institute in California!). Now, Michael has the potential to join a membership that would not only provide him access to AAF again, but to BAF, COE, and all of our memberships in the four year space.

In May, Soltan identified an awesome lead while speaking with Joyce Noel, the Director of Revenue Cycle at Excela Health. During an onsite, Soltan and Joyce began chatting about patient payments and estimations. Knowing that Payment Navigation Compass could address those areas, Soltan mentioned our resources and was able to articulate how they could add value to the work Joyce was already doing with Payment Integrity Compass. Ultimately, Soltan was able to provide an introduction and to generate strong interest in an initial PayNav conversation. Great lead, Soltan! </p>

In fact, Honky Tonks are very real, very fun, and veryyy free (just in case any of you loyal Daily Lead readers are like me, a Honky Tonk is: “an establishment that contains at least one rockin’ stage, cold beverages, and a party that lasts all day, every day”).  Sounds pretty great, right?? Well, as it turns out, Nashville has an entire street dedicated to Honky Tonks. Honky Tonk Highway, as it’s called, is lined with bars and clubs, and they’re known to bump music from 10:00AM-3:00AM. I’ve only just learned what they are… but I already love them. </p>

                        <p>Attention West Coast employees: OAB has found the perfect way for you to wine down this summer. This year, the 2016 Bay Area A-List awards voted <a class="bluelink" src="http://www.stageleftcellars.com/">Stage Left Cellars</a> as the best San Francisco Winery, a contest which is based on more than 19,000 votes. AKA, we’re not the only ones who think visiting this winery is a good idea. Located in Oakland, this vineyard hand sorts individual berries so that only the best fruits make it into the fermentation process and then they stomp the grapes with their feet (we’re happy to report that they use food grade rubber boots when stomping!). As you’ve probably guessed, this wine doesn’t come cheap, but pass a few OAB leads and you’ll be covered! ;) </p>

                <h4><i><mark>OAB has some exciting updates to Medallion Status!</mark></i></h4>

                <p>The 2016 Summer Olympic Games will begin in less than three months. However, you don’t have to go as far as Rio for a chance to win Bronze, Silver, or Gold. In fact, right here at The Advisory Board Company, you even have the chance to go Platinum. While OAB can’t promise you international athletic fame and glory, we can say with confidence that we have lots of cash, swag, and bragging rights to go around.</p>

                <br>

                <h6>Let the Games Begin</h6>

                <p>If you’ll remember back to about a month ago, we put some ambitious goals in front of the company. We finished out 2015 with 758 lead passers with a Medallion Status of Bronze or higher, which resulted in over 4500 marketing visits. </p>

                <p>This year, we challenge the firm to raise the number of Medallion Status lead passers to 1000 – 700 Bronze, 125 Silver, 75 Gold, and 100 Platinum. It may sound aspirational, but just like the superstar athletes gearing up to compete in this summer’s games, we have the utmost faith in you! And still, if our unwavering support doesn’t convince you, let’s take a look at how we’re pacing already. So far this year we have…</p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li><b>420</b> OAB lead passers at <b class="bronze">Bronze</b> (60% of goal)</li>
                    <li><b>68</b> OAB lead passers at <b class="silver">Silver</b> (54% of goal)</li>
                    <li><b>22</b> OAB lead passers at <b class="gold">Gold</b> (29% of goal)</li>
                    <li><b>29</b> OAB lead passers at <b class="platinum">Platinum</b> (29% of goal)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>That puts us (yes, that includes the OAB team – we are visit generators too!) at 539 employees with a Medallion Status of Bronze or higher, 461 away from our goal of 1000. With over a month left in the half, we are <u><b>well</b></u> on our way.</p>

                <br>

                <h6>Early Front-Runners</h6>

                <p>First, we’d like to give a special shout out to the top 6 visit generators at the firm so far this year:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><b>Michal Abraham:</b> <mark>64.33 visits</mark></li>
                    <li><b>Harrison Fanaroff:</b> <mark>45.83 visits</mark></li>
                    <li><b>James Millard:</b> <mark>40.5 visits</mark></li>
                    <li><b>Owen Crean:</b> <mark>37.5 visits</mark></li>
                    <li><b>Sarah Comer:</b> <mark>37 visits</mark></li>
                    <li><b>Brett Schenkel:</b> <mark>32.5 visits</mark></li>
                </ol>

                <p>Second, we’d like to recognize those individuals who have already reached Platinum level Medallion Status. As you can see above, we are the furthest away from our Platinum Goal, so a special thanks to these folks that have helped us make some progress:</p>

                <p class="indent"><i><mark>Gregory Papillon, Olivia Millard, Jay Fovel, Luis Ferreira, Devin Airey, Eleanor Hofstedt, Kyla Normand, Matthew Feger, Stephanie Schmidt, Laura Swenson, Sarah Zello, Justine Chan, Kristen Harvey, Brittney Sceals, Lindsay Brewster, Lex Ruby Howe, A.J. Nagaraj, Kathryn Bailey, Caitlin Ursini, Erik Candy, Aaron Knowlton, Brad Haas, Doug Montesano, Brett Schenkel, Sarah Comer, Owen Crean, James Millard, Harrison Fanaroff, Michal Abraham</mark></i></p>

                <br>

                <h6>You Mentioned Some Perks?</h6>

                <p>We sure did. This year, in addition to our usual incentives for outstanding OAB visit generation – H2 Visit Tournament (*now open to the whole firm!), Annual Platinum Reception, and OAB swag – we’d like to announce a couple new ones:</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>Platinum Plus:</b> This year, OAB lead passers whose leads result in 30 or more OAB visits will be given this prestigious title. As a thank you, we will be setting up a lunch series in which Platinum Plus Medallion Status holders will have lunch with members of the Executive Team. We’ve already had several folks hit this milestone so stay tuned for your exclusive invite!</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>Health Care Delivery and Research Platinum Challenge:</b> Historically, no one from either of these groups has reached Platinum level Medallion Status. This year, the first person from each to hit 15 visits will win some cash-money from OAB!</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>(Last but not least) Bragging Rights:</b> There are currently about 2200 marketing visits scheduled off of OAB leads and the top tier of visit generators alone are projected to increase firm NBB by $7M. I know we couldn’t promise everyone a spot in the international athletic hall of fame, but those stats are pretty powerful. </p>

There are clear synergies between EAB’s research and technology and the services that Royall provides.

                <p><b><i>Posted by Chris Marett on Apr 19, 2016</i></b></p>

                <p>In my role as president of Royall &amp; Company, I’ve fielded a lot of questions from Royall clients, education leaders and our own employees about the combination of EAB and Royall and what it really means.</p>

                <p>To be fair, I’ve worked in business long enough to understand that many mergers don’t really create value for customers and that the higher education field is rife with mergers “in name alone,” where customers see virtually no benefit and cultures oftentimes clash. For that reason, I’m more than okay with the sometimes candid and challenging queries. </p>

                <p>But when it comes down to it, everyone is wondering, Why would a best-practice firm want to combine with an enrollment management company?</p>

                <h6>An opportunity to make an even bigger impact</h6>

                <p>Now that we have more than a year of experience under our collective belts, I can give a clear answer that is borne out by the facts: The reason that EAB joined forces with Royall &amp; Company is that as a combined entity, we are able to have an even bigger impact on the world of higher education and more effectively address the most pressing challenges facing our college and university partners.</p>

                <p>First of all, while we have a lot in common, our competencies and approaches are complementary to each other.</p>

                <p>EAB is, at its heart, devoted to research-based approaches to discover and implement best practices. Every year EAB teams take difficult, complex issues that members are wrestling with and identify the most effective solutions and strategies. Even if EAB uses quantitative data in the course of our work, the firm sees its job as helping members find the right answers to their problems, and that requires synthesizing hundreds of case studies, interviews and other sources of information.</p>

                <p>On the other hand, one way to look at Royall &amp; Company is that it's a huge real-world laboratory. Each year, Royall works with hundreds of schools on recruitment and advancement campaigns, and it applies a deeply rooted belief in the importance of testing and innovation to its work. In fact, the Royall data science team runs more than 300 experiments – every year – to determine which tactics are most effective and in which circumstances they are most successful.</p>

                <p>So you can see the commonality: Across EAB and Royall, we all have a deep commitment to the idea of "best practice" and improving performance, with the only variability occurring on how we apply that commitment.</p>

                <p>Let me give you just one example of how these capabilities come together: Our tremendously talented EAB infographics team recently produced an infographic summarizing the findings from recent Royall &amp; Company enrollment marketing experiments.</p>

                <h6>More synergy, more insight</h6>

                <p>It's not hard to see how we can work together in other ways as well. Ideas from EAB's research can be tested, validated and refined in Royall's real-world marketing experiments. Likewise, things we discover by mining the billions of interactions that Royall has with students and alumni can feed into EAB's insights.</p>

                <p>That means that with these synergies, EAB members get even better strategic guidance and even more effective platforms; Royall clients get even more impactful outreach and ultimately an even stronger return on their investment.</p>

                <p>But it's not just about complementary approaches. EAB and Royall together possess data sources that cover the entire student lifecycle, from before the time when college is even a glimmer in students’ minds, all the way through to their college reunions.</p>

                <p>Our data scientists have been able to find out, for example, that students who are actively recruited to their college through multichannel marketing campaigns actually give at higher rates as alumni, compared to so-called "stealth applicants" who didn't receive pre-enrollment marketing.</p>

                <p>In another study [New Clues about What Drives First-Year Persistence], we worked with three schools who are part of EAB's Student Success Collaborative and also are Royall &amp; Company clients for enrollment marketing. In that initial cohort, we found that the later a student applies, the less likely he or she is to make it through the first year.</p>

                <p>These are just two examples of insights that we’re already deriving from our combined data assets, but we are just getting started. I’m genuinely excited about how, over the next several years, the combination of EAB and Royall will work to solve the most pressing challenges facing our college and university partners and help make higher education smarter and more effective.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>Predicting 2016 outcomes</mark></i></h4>

                <p>It's almost that time of year again... H1 is nearing it's end, and top contenders are turning up the heat to prepare for the 2016 H2 Visit Tournament. This year, with the entire firm eligible for a slot in the bracket, we decided to take a look at our bracket qualifiers as of now and make a few logical predictions...</p>

                <p>Remember, at the end of H1, the <b>top 64 OAB visit generators</b> in the firm will be entered into a NCAA Tournament style bracket. Each month, qualifiers compete in a one-on-one duel against another contender to generate the most visits. The winner moves forward and on to the next round to compete for the grand prize. </p>

                <p>Awesome alert: we sent 2015 winner James Millard to Fiji... all expenses paid.) Who will be the winner in 2016? And where will we send them on vacation? Only time will tell, but let's take a look at how the bracket would look today.</p>

                <h6>Here's how we made our predictions:</h6>
                    <ul class="bulletsindent">
                        <li class="indent">We took the top 64 OAB visit generators in the firm as of <b>this week</b>, and matched them up against each other in the first round of the bracket.</li>
                        <li class="indent">We calculated each player's individual 2016 OAB lead-to-visit conversion rate to use as a hypothetical indicator of their performance potential in the tournament.</li>
                        <li class="indent">We let the bracket "play" itself out - in each round, we moved the player with the higher conversion rate forward. We're excited to see if our predictions hold up at the end of H2!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <br>

                    <p>We could be on the right track with our guesses, or wildly off, but with some veteran MVPs and some rookie hotshots ranking among the top 80 visit generators this month, H2 2016 is sure to bring an exciting Visit Tournament!</p>

                    <p><b>Here are the top 80 OAB visit generators in the firm who have a strong chance of making it onto the bracket:</b></p>

For this lead, Tess reached out to the Senior Vice President of Marketing &amp; Communications at OSF HealthCare System (Susan Milford) who previously worked with Tess at BJC Healthcare. Through her conversations with Susan, Tess was able to provide an introduction, secure a visit, and bring all Strategic Marketing Directors at OSF into a meeting.

Theresa was interviewing a candidate for a Coordinator role when the candidate mentioned that she had family that worked at Massachusetts General. Once the interviewee began discussing that Massachusetts General was going through Epic Implementation, Theresa realized that this could potentially be a great opportunity for Clinovations.

Following the call, Allyn sent OAB a very clearly outlined emailed detailing the contact’s interests and the potential leads. Once the Marketers were assigned, Allyn provided a detailed list of next steps and offered to act a central point of contact for all of the Marketers involved.

                <div class="leadpassersection clearfix">

                    <h10><i>Aside from your normal pitch, what questions do you ask contacts in order to help identify what they’re interested in?</i></h10>

                    <p class="indent"><b><text class="bluetext">John:</text></b>   I ask them about their responsibilities and try to get a better understanding of what they do on a day-to-day basis. Getting a feel for their role and the projects they’re working on help me to better understand what products best align with their work.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b><text class="purple">Rachel:</text></b> Sometimes, instead of asking them a ton of questions, I try to focus on what questions they’re asking. I work on PDI, which overlaps with a number of different products. So, once I get the conversation started, it can be easier to identify what aspects of PDI they’re interested in (or not interested in) by listening to them talk.</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b><text class="bluetext">John:</b></text> I also make sure that I thoroughly scrub the contact and institution I’m about to call. I like to particularly focus on strategic plans. If you take a look at a strategic plan it can help you to identify what that institution is focused on and you can tailor your questions to those interests. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h10><i>What do you do if a contact says they’re not interested in your product?</i></h10>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="purple"><b>Rachel:</b></text> If it’s over the phone, and they seem willing to talk, I try to re-direct the conversation by asking them what projects they are currently focused on. Even if they’re not interested in my product, I can get a better understanding of what resources they might find valuable. </p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="bluetext"><b>John:</b></text> If someone says they’re not interested in my product I try to continue the conversation by asking some broader questions (instead of just focusing in on the scope of my product). For example, I might say: “I know a lot of hospitals are focused on Value Based Care…is that something you’re working on right now?”</p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="purple"><b>Rachel:</b></text> If I get a no over email, I’ll send a follow up email asking them about what their priorities are. A lot of times they’ll end up replying and telling me, “we’re actually focused on…”</p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="bluetext"><b>John:</b></text> Scrubbing the institution’s website can also help you to prepare for pushback. If you already know that a Hospital is focusing on a particular initiative, then you can guide the conversation in that direction. </p>

                    <br>

                    <h10><i>How do you familiarize yourself with other ABC products? </i></h10>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="bluetext"><b>John:</b></text> During team meetings we’ll sometimes have MA’s on our team talk about their products to the rest of the team, this way we’re able to learn more about how other products differ or complement our own products. </p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="purple"><b>Rachel:</b></text> Working with my team/Marketer to run campaigns for products that overlap with PDI has probably helped me the most. It’s given me exposure to new products and a better understanding of what products align most closely with PDI. </p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="bluetext"><b>John:</b></text>You can also utilize Box to look at content if you have a particular product you want to learn more about. (TIP: The OAB Website also has product one pagers and links to folders in Box with additional resources!)</p>

                    <br>

                    <h10><i>What other lead passing tips would you like to offer your fellow Marketing Associates?</i></h10>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="purple"><b>Rachel:</b></text> Put time on your calendar each week to remind yourself to review your opportunities and to see if there are any potential leads you can pass. Even if you don’t have any leads to pass that week it helps to remind you to keep leads in mind during calls with potential new members. </p>

                    <p class="indent"><text class="bluetext"><b>John:</b></text> On our team, lead passing is very much a part of the team culture. Everyone shares intel with each other. If lead passing isn’t as common on your team, be proactive. Go over to a teammates desk and talk through the intel you have—they’re likely to return the favor.</p>

In previous years, participants: pet alpacas, played with robots, learned indigenous dances, took karate lessons, painted pictures, watched educational videos, participated in henna demonstrations, learned how to wrap saris, and were gifted Guatemalan worry dolls, maracas, balloons, hats, tote bags, and more!</p>

                        <p>Time travel just got a little bit easier. Hosted throughout May, this festival will take you back to 16th century England, all without the help of Doc Brown and his time-traveling car! All you have to do is make your way to Arrington, Tennessee, where you’ll find their annual Renaissance Festival sprawled out on 60 rolling acres. The event will feature musicians, magicians, over 60 artisans, a life-size castle, jousting tournaments, camel rides, and theatrical performances. Alright…so maybe it won’t be EXACTLY like traveling back to 16th century England, but you won’t have to make your parents fall in love again, you probably won’t get shot at, and there will be turkey legs the size of your face…so sounds like a win to us!</p>

                <h3><a name="post147">The Only Spring Cleaning You Need to Do This Year</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>A guide to cleaning up the nursing strategic plan</mark></i></h4>

                <img class="hcabpic" src="../img/blog/cleaningiscoming.png">

                <p>Spring cleaning has a tendency to be time-consuming and difficult, and thus inevitably ignored. When the time comes to start cleaning the dirt you have been pushing into the corner for a year and fishing through those junk drawers, it can seem impossible to figure out where to start. What rooms should you prioritize? What can wait a few months? How clean is really clean?</p>

                <p>What if you had a pre-made plan that allowed you to easily prioritize your needs and goals to ensure that your cleaning is as effective and efficient as possible?  Look no further than the <b><a class="bluelink" href="https://www.advisory.com/research/nursing-executive-center/tools/2016/nursing-strategic-scorecard#scorecard" target="blank">Nursing Strategic Scorecard</a></b>.</p>

                <p>It’s not only you who finds spring cleaning cumbersome and frustrating.  For nursing teams, the process of creating or updating their strategic plan can be long and complex, and often overlooked.</p>

                <p>To overcome this problem, best-in-class nursing organizations are moving away from long documents that are all too often ignored and now creating short strategic scorecards that can be read at a glance.</p>

                <p>These streamlined strategic plans benefit nursing teams in many ways—they demonstrate how nursing is advancing critical organizational goals, help focus nursing leaders and frontline staff on those goals without spreading them too thinly, and give nurse leaders at-a-glance information on performance for their most important projects and metrics.</p>

                

                <div class="bettext">

                <p>The <b>Nursing Executive Center</b> has created an easy-to-use template for refreshing and building nursing strategic plans. The strategic plan template:</p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li><b>Can be easily customized</b>. It doesn’t require any data entry or formatting. Just delete what isn’t right for the organization.</li>
                    <li><b>Has easy-to-read formatting</b>. The strategic plan is already formatted and ready to be shared with external audiences.</li>
                    <li><b>Contains direct links to the Nursing Executive Center’s most relevant resources</b>. Project owners can get a jump-start on their projects by tapping into our tools, templates, and best practices.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                </div>

                <br><img class="betpic" src="../img/blog/whatsnext.png"><br>Wouldn’t it be nice if spring cleaning was this easy?<br><br>

                <p>Four months ago the Health Care Advisory Board launched the <a class="bluelink" href="http://one.advisory.com/campaigns/hcabroadto100.html">Road to 100 Percent campaign</a>. Since its launch we have worked with Consulting and Management, R&amp;I Account Management, PT Account Management, Delivery, and R&amp;I Marketing and gathered information for organizations all across the country in the growth, pure prospect, EA, and NASA terrains.</p>

                <p>This campaign focuses on securing interactions with, or gathering market intelligence from, the remaining HCAB prospect organizations in an effort to understand and capture as much of the remaining market opportunity as possible.</p>

                <p>Our role as go-to advisor for executive teams grants us the privilege of serving as their thought partner and the opportunity for a two-way channel with the most progressive organizations in health care is critical. This level of exposure is critical to the firm’s broader business.</p>

                <p>With already 72%+ of the viable market, HCAB team is well on its way to hitting the 100% mark. But, it will require the help and support from all parts of the firm.</p>

                <p>We know there are many “golden tickets” crucial to the success of this campaign and we look forward to expanding our internal partnerships to learn the priorities of, and how best we can serve, the remaining prospects pool of HCAB prospects.</p>

                <p>Please direct any market intelligence, leads, or introductions you may be able to make to organizations that do not have HCAB, to the <a class="bluelink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com">OAB team</a>.</p>

                <h3><a name="post142">And You Thought the NCAA Tournament Was Fun?</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Just wait until the H2 Visit Tournament starts</mark></i></h4>

                <p>What’s the best part of tournament time? Upsets and Cinderellas? Filling out a bracket? Watching four TVs at once and not feeling bad about it? All those things are great, but the best part for me is that it means the OAB H2 Visit Tournament is right around the corner!</p>

                <p>And as I was watching the Elite Eight of the NCAAs this past weekend, I noticed a number of parallels between the Final Four bound teams and our own 2015 H2VT Final Four.</p>

                <div class="citysection clearfix">

                    <h4 class="citytitle">Caitlin Ursini = North Carolina Tar Heels</h4>
                    
                    <div class="bettext">

                    <p>This year’s Tar Heels are one of the top overall seeds, entering the tournament as one of the favorites to win at all – and throughout the tournament they have done nothing to change that narrative winning all of their games by double digits. They enter this weekend as odds-on favorite of cutting down the nets.</p>

                    <p>Entering the Four of the 2015 H2VT, Caitlin found herself in a very similar position. She was the top overall seed in the field, and she spent the first four rounds racking up impressive wins. Much like UNC come tournament time, you expect to see Caitlin aiming for the big victory, and it’s only a matter of time until she wins it all.</p>

                    </div>

                    <h4 class="citytitle">James Millard = Villanova Wildcats</h4>
                    
                    <div class="bettext">

                    <p>Rewind two weeks – would anyone have been surprised to learn that Villanova made the Final Four? Probably not, but not many people were picking them. They come from an under-appreciated conference, haven’t proven themselves nationally, and were matched up against a juggernaut Kansas Jayhawks team. So all they did was embarrass the competition in the first three rounds before showing real fight winning a great Elite Eight game over Kansas.</p>

                    <p>Like Villanova, James comes from an under-appreciated department – Growth Account Management. And like James, the number 1 seed in his quadrant (Michal Abraham) looked ready to walk to the Final Four. But James knew what he was capable of and calmly dispatched all comers for six months to win the whole competition.</p>

                    <div class="bettext">

                    <p>What can you say about the Oklahoma Sooners? They have the best player in college basketball (Buddy Hield), they impressed all season long in this year’s best conference (the Big 12), and they handled their NCAA Tournament matchups through the Elite Eight without any drama.</p>

                    <p>Entering the Final Four, many of the experts have tapped them as the biggest threat to the Tar Heels coronation. Sounds quite a bit like Brad Haas. One of the top lead passers throughout qualifying? Check. From the top lead passing department in the firm? Check. Calmly beat challengers through the first four rounds? Check. Looking back to the start of the H2VT Final Four last year, I would likely have pegged Brad as having the best chance to halt Caitlin on the way to victory.</p>

                    <div class="bettext">

                    <p>Did anyone see the Orange coming? They entered the brackets as a controversial 10-seed, with many thinking they didn’t even deserve a trip to the Dance. They moved forward early with favorable matchups in the first weekend, and gutted out two impressive wins against top competition in the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight.</p>

                    <p>Much like the Orange, Sharon entered the 2015 H2VT toward the bottom of the bracket; she was one of the last competitors to qualify, and certainly wasn’t expected to compete for the title. She proved everyone wrong using a mix of gamesmanship and determination to win some very tough matchups in Rounds 3 and 4 en route to a big second place finish overall. Does this mean that we can bank on Villanova beating Syracuse for the NCAA Tournament title? If it were legal here in D.C., I might place a bet.</p>

                <p>There seems to be a smartphone app for everything these days, aimed to make your life easier. Similarly, it feels like there is an ABC or EAB product for everything in the Health Care and Higher Ed worlds.</p>

                <p>So what does that mean? So many opportunities for you to pass OAB leads! What <i>else</i> does that mean? You’ll have to navigate your way through the firm’s library of resources to decide the right kind of lead to pass (which we understand isn’t always the easiest). And even when you find the product to solve your member’s issues, you may be unsure of how to best introduce it...</p>

                <p>Good news: <b>there is someone in your department that can help you figure it out!</b></p>

                <p class="indent"><b>OAB Ambassadors</b> are individuals selected by the OAB team/their own senior leadership to motivate colleagues to continually invest in product-offering education, hit OAB metrics, and therefore drive growth through solving their members’ most pressing issues.</p>

                <p class="indent">In layman’s terms? They’re <i>really</i> good at passing leads, and they want to share their secrets. Ambassadors meet with the OAB team on a regular basis to stay up to date on team metrics (lead/visit/unit numbers), campaign standings, and new product offerings.</p>

                <p>We’ll end with some helpful tips from some tenured Ambassadors (thanks to <b>Keary Nance</b> and <b>Kate Vonderhaar</b> for their wisdom!)</p>

                <p class="honorabletitle"><i><b>For lead passers...</b></i></p>

                <p><b>Q:</b> What is the single most powerful thing you can do to be a better lead passer?</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>A:</b> “Be educated on our products, know their value proposition, and know what key phrases to listen for.”</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>A:</b> “Be a specialist—pick one or two products that fit most naturally with the conversations you’re already having with executives. For example, I spend a lot of time on the phone with HR executives who already participate in the HR Advancement Center. The strongest leads from those conversations are often for our Employee Engagement Survey or Talent Development partnerships. Don’t feel like you have to memorize all our products to pass a good lead!”</p>

                <p class="honorabletitle"><i><b>For fellow Ambassadors...</b></i></p>

                <p><b>Q:</b> What are some best practices you can share to help your groups hit their OAB goals?</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>A:</b> “Education has been the most successful tool for Crimson Clinical success.  Ensure the presenters’ content is relevant to the team.  Prewire with presenters so they are aware of what the team expectations are and what types of questions they will ask.  Prep your presenters.”</p>

                    <p class="indent"><b>A:</b> “Be thorough but quick: a 5- to 10-minute presentation during an already-scheduled department meeting is a great way to remind people about OAB and let them know how they’re tracking against goals.”</p>

                <p>Every single EAB member wishes they could attract more applicants (yes, even Harvard). Royall and Company, which became the newest part of EAB a year ago, ensures that they will.  Together, we are solving the student success challenge in a way that no one else can – by confirming a student goes to the right school for them, and is set up from day 1 to graduate on time.</p>

                <br>

                <h10 class="honorabletitle">Here are some of the highlights from the presentations during Royall Signature Week:</h10>

                <p><b>Chris Marett</b> taught us who Royall is and the impact they have had on the enrollment management market for over 25 years. Specifically, Chris explained how Royall &amp; Co. offers enrollment management support through data-driven technology and research. It was made clear that Royall’s massive data sets (1.2 billion student interactions every year) and proprietary methodologies (financial aid optimization and yield predictive analytics) is what sets them apart.</p>

                <p><b>Peter Farrell</b> showed us why Royall is critical to the success of 350+ schools that they work with. For example, with their work at St. Edwards University, he showed us how Royall not only increased their enrollment numbers but increased the quality of each student and the overall net tuition revenue:</p>

In recent years, OAB has launched: The Great OAB Road Trip, Around the World, and most recently, <a class="bluelink" href="../campaigns/amazingrace.html">The Amazing Race: OAB Edition</a>. In the Amazing Race, individuals in Delivery and Consulting &amp; Management departments race around the globe by way of eight epic prize locations. Players gain distance by passing OAB leads, scheduling OAB visits, and securing OAB units. As the race progresses, OAB has seen a number of great leads and strong individual performances. However, this month, OAB would like to give an extra shout out to William Harmon for maintaining a top spot in the race. Being a more recent addition to EAB, the GradesFirst team hasn’t had many opportunities to win OAB competitions, but it looks like William is well on his way. Will OAB see its first GradesFirst race winner? Check back in on June 30th and find out! </p>

However, while OAB received an enormous amount leads, one particular lead passer really stood out: Chloe Lewis. Chloe sent in leads for 11 schools--all with very detailed background information. We think that Scott’s response to Chole’s email says it all: “WOW, Chloe. This is single-handedly the most impressive and helpful email I have ever received on any One Advisory Board outreach I have ever sent”.

This month, we would like to nominate him for a number of leads, all of which demonstrated his ability to identify the strategic priorities of potential new members. In several leads that John passed, contacts indicated that they were not interested in the Nursing Executive Center. However, when the contacts declined to meet for this product, instead of hanging up, John was able to change the direction of the conversations, and identify what the potential new members were interested in. By adding this extra step to each of his conversations, John was able to help facilitate conversations around relevant products, helping both the potential new member, and ABC marketers. Great work, John! </p>

                        <p>On Monday, March 28th the White House will host one of its largest events of the year: the <a class="bluelink" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/eastereggroll" target="blank">annual Easter Egg Roll</a>. Originally, children in the D.C. area would gather at Capitol Hill the Monday after Easter to compete in a race where they would literally roll Easter eggs using long wooden spoons. However, due to growing crowds, Members of Congress eventually passed an Act that prohibited egg rolling on Capitol grounds. Then, in 1878, after being approached by a number of young children, President Rutherford B. Hayes opened up the White House grounds for the event. Since then, successive Presidents have maintained the tradition. During the event this year, the South Lawn will host sports, cooking classes, live music, storytelling, an Easter egg hunt, and, of course, the Easter Bunny himself. </p>

                <h3><a name="post133">What Hospitals Should Take Away From The 2016 Presidential Candidates</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>And how our Talent Development curriculums can help</mark></i></h4>

                <p>We spend a lot of time watching debates, reading proposals, and arguing with friends over who the best presidential candidate is. Regardless of who you’re supporting, it’s clear that each candidate’s leadership skills have gotten them to where they are.</p>

                <p>So, what should hospitals and health systems take away from this? Well, leadership skills are honed through years of on-the-job experience, individual coaching, and training.</p>

                <p>But, unfortunately, most hospitals and health systems often don’t offer the development opportunities necessary to help build a pipeline of leaders - or staff simply don’t know about the resources available to them. With increased competition from both new and existing competitors, hospitals need strong leaders now more than ever before who are able to lead staff, and their organizations at large, through unprecedented change and uncertainty.</p>

                <p>That’s where our <b>customized Talent Development curriculums</b> come in. We offer <b>leadership training</b>, <b>education</b>, and <b>skill development</b> for health care leaders at all levels, including physicians, nurses, administrators, and frontline staff—aligned with members’ unique missions and strategic goals. </p>

                <p>While CLOs and VPs of HR tend to run point on leadership development initiatives, CEOs, CNOs, and CMOs are also likely to mention the need for a leadership development strategy with concerns such as:</p>

                <ul class="indent">
                    <li>“Staff are resistant to change”</li>
                    <li>“Leaders are struggling to implement strategy”</li>
                    <li>“Our culture is not adaptable”</li>
                    <li>“New roles or processes are being built and my staff aren’t ready for the changes”</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you hear any of these arise in conversation with a member, you should <a class="bluelink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com"><u><b>pass an OAB lead</b></u></a>!</p>

                    <p>When comparing the quality of customer relationships, hospitals are falling to the bottom – alongside the dreaded cable company. By contrast, newer, alternative providers like Walgreens and CVS share space with heavy hitters on consumer experience, like Amazon and Apple. Patient experience and cultivating loyalty are going to matter more and more as the health care environment becomes more competitive.</p>

                    <p>There is also a huge financial upside to getting patient experience right. Improving patient loyalty just 10 percent—from an average of 44 percent share of patient wallet to 54 percent—has the potential to yield an additional <b>$22 million in revenue</b>. For that kind of return, more and more executives should be focusing on patient experience to maintain patient loyalty (if they aren’t already).</p>

                <p>Unfortunately, many organizations don’t have the tools or visibility to inform their strategies. <b>But that’s where iRound comes in</b>. It enables:</p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li>Real-time data collection and monitoring across sites of care, including process and quality audits.</li>
                    <li>A seamless system for identifying and addressing service deficiencies across the organization.</li>
                    <li>The analytics and reporting allow members to create system-wide accountability, and transparency to drive systematic process improvements.</li>
                </ul>

                </div>

                <p>The tool is also designed to work with our members’ existing workflow, and includes the broader services and the support of the Advisory Board to drive adoption and ensure results.</p>

                <p>Below is an example of how this works using a case study from Cedars-Sinai. <a class="bluelink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine"><b><i>Benzodiazepine</i></b></a> is a class of drugs prescribed to treat insomnia, muscle spasms, or as premedication for medical procedures etc. However, it is known that that Benzodiazepines causes an increased risk of falling for elderly patients, and therefore is considered an inappropriate medication for those 65+ years.</p>

                <p>At Cedars-Sinai Health System, the use around CDS around the prescription of Benzodiazepines resulted in a 12% cancellation rate of prescriptions, and 27% average rate of orders not placed. This demonstrates a significant change in behavior as a result of CDS. The downstream effects of not ordering those prescriptions includes cost savings of $6.7M, and most importantly, an increase in the safety and health of patients: 20 fewer fall related injuries, 9 fewer visits to the ED, and 2 fewer deaths from falls.</p>

                <p>Our infographic below summarizes the findings of this case study.

                <p>I think we can all agree with Justin Bieber... Trying to decipher mixed messages is frustrating.</p>

                <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/jbeebs.jpg">

                <p>This problem can be especially frustrating for health systems trying to communicate with their physicians about important and potentially life-saving initiatives like quality, cost, and coding. Email is broken: the average physician receives over 2000 broadcast messages per year. And, health systems <i>need</i> physicians to feel that they are kept informed of the organization’s strategic plan and direction—it is a top engagement driver—yet, just 49% of the 23,000+ physicians we’ve surveyed believe that they have this information.</p>

                <p>Luckily, there’s an app for that. <b>Crimson Connect</b> is our new mobile technology that simplifies and streamlines communications for providers by cutting out noise and providing only relevant content.

                <h4><i><mark>James Millard on how to be an OAB rock star (and win epic prizes)</mark></i></h4>

                <div class="leadpassersection clearfix">

                    <img class="hcabpic" src="../img/ambassador/millard_james.jpg">

                    <p>As an OAB ambassador and frequent lead passer, I’m often asked how I’m able to make One Advisory Board such a big part of my day-to-day.  With over 250 leads passed and 65 resulting visits in 2015, I’ve grown pretty comfortable balancing marketing and my service and renewal duties as an R&amp;I RM.</p>

                    <p>For those who rarely think of OAB unless a member reaches out directly about a product, it probably seems like I must devote half of my time to passing leads. In truth, I don’t spend much of my week on OAB because I’ve established a regular process, and I’ve established mutually beneficial relationships with a handful of capable MAs.</p>

                    <p>I’ve noticed that there are some concrete processes I have put in place that have made my consistent OAB engagement possible. Below, I've shared four best practices that can help anyone become a successful OAB lead passer.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="leadpassersection clearfix">

                    <h4 class="honorabletitle">1. Get to know a few MAs and marketers in your territory.</h4>

                    <p class="indent">For account managers specifically, the best way to become an OAB rock star is to outsource the job.  MAs reach out to get restrictions cleared or to get background about member organizations, and it’s well worth 30 minutes here and there to sit down with an MA and discuss your shared pool.  In the future, that MA can always reach out to you for introductions or background information, meaning those small, occasional investments of time pay dividends through regular opportunities to pass low-effort leads. Additionally, once you’ve built these relationships, you’ll be able to trust MAs to follow the processes that you’ve put in place (a common problem that AM encounters).</p>

                    <h4 class="honorabletitle">2. Set clear and realistic expectations for collaboration with marketing.</h4>

                    <p class="indent">The top lead passers I’ve worked with have often had their favorite MAs.  Those who respect account managers’ time and prepare appropriately will be able to keep coming back for a consistent source of leads.  When a potential lead passer meets with an MA for the first time, if clear expectations are set on how to operate, the pair can have a valuable relationship for the rest of the MA’s tenure and built the mutual trust that I mentioned above.</p>

                    <h4 class="honorabletitle">3. Introduce a plan with members for how marketing should happen.</h4>

                    <p class="indent">For any member-facing, service-focused role, there will always be a few reservations about introducing marketing.  The primary focus is, and should be, the health of the current relationship and the upcoming renewal.</p>

                    <p class="indent">However, there’s absolutely a way to align the two goals.  Members recognize that marketing is part of our business model and you can establish a process for introducing marketing in an appropriate way.  People tend to be receptive to receiving straightforward information on a regular basis, as opposed to constant emails with variant scripting from MAs.</p>

                    <h4 class="honorabletitle">4. Learn about our offerings.</h4>

                    <p class="indent">One Advisory Board is always available as a resource if you’re not sure whether something is a lead, but I’ve also found it valuable to independently broaden my knowledge base when I can.  Many of our members think of us as just a research company, or just a technology company, and I’ve surprised members in the moment by explaining the breadth of our offerings.</p>

                    <p class="indent">While it’s true that not every member-facing role at The Advisory Board has the opportunity that we R&amp;I RMs have, just about everyone can learn about members’ priorities and connect them with an ABC product that can prove helpful to their organization and deepen the relationship.</p>

A number of Heads of Schools in Washington, D.C. have come to know EAB and its work well, and asked whether we might consider providing them with best practice research.</p>

                            <p>Kathy Jamieson at National Cathedral School helped us host a roundtable last October of 30 heads of school from across the U.S. to advise us on how we might be of service.

                    <p><i class="honorable">Research &amp; Insights OAB Campaign</i> <br>Jared Landis has been dominating the lead passing game. For one, in OAB's Research &amp; Insights Q4 2015 campaign Jared led by example by passing 22 OAB leads between November 1st and December 16th. Jared also managed to pass the most leads during that timeframe, which contributed to the department crushing their campaign goals. So far, those leads have already resulted in four marketing visits in 2016. But, want to know our favorite part? Many of the leads stemmed out of an onsite presentation in which Jared took the time to follow-up with prospective members afterwards. I know we’re not the only ones who appreciate the time and effort Jared invested in creating these high quality leads—keep up the great work Jared! </p>

Greg Quantz has passed 75 leads in January alone, he has passed more leads than any other Associate Principal in 2016, and if that wasn’t impressive enough, he has managed to pass leads for a wide range of products, including: C&amp;M, iRound, and Crimson upsells.

However, being the lead passing expert that he is, Sean was still able to spot this atypical NBB opportunity and loop in the appropriate ABC employees. This is how it happened: Sean’s Dad is the landlord for an ABC member, H+L Architects. Sean discovered that H+L was about to merge with a larger company, Treanor Architects, who is not yet an ABC member. Since finding out that Sean works for The Advisory Board employees of H+L have continually mentioned to Sean’s Dad how valuable they find their membership with ABC. Realizing that he could leverage this relationship, Sean was able to loop in the account manager at H+L Architects and help to get a conversation around ABC started at Treanor Architects. Sean, all we can say is: we’ll miss you when you transition to Dedicated Advisor, but we can’t wait to see what amazing leads you pass our way! </p>

Rachel’s lead highlights an excellent new opportunity for ABC employees (particularly MA’s) to pass OAB leads. Having graduated from Head-Royce School in 2011, Rachel was able to leverage her relationships there to provide an introduction to the assigned Marketer. In her introduction, Rachel delivered a brief personalized summary of what she’s been doing since graduation, a short summary of EAB, and a clear description of the Forum. Rachel, great job getting this introduction out so quickly! OAB is definitely hoping to see a lot more of these leads in the coming weeks! </p>

                <h4><i><mark>How this graduate made a $1.9M impact</mark></i></h4> 

                <p>We know you're big fans of OAB, so we're sure you're familiar with <a class="bluelink" href="http://one.advisory.com/campaigns/cmmba.html" target="blank"><u>Consulting &amp; Management's MBA Program</u></a>. We had roughly 150+ graduates of the program in 2015, many of which passed great leads across the year.</p> 

                <img class="hcabpic" src="../img/blog/headshots/mmekomekon.jpg">

                <p>However, we wanted to take a moment to recognize one special MBA-certified staff: <b>Mmekom Ekon</b>.</p>

                <p>During the course of becoming MBA-certified, Mmekom worked closely with both <b>Rachel Krasnow</b>, Business Development Manager for the Hospital Performance Management team, and <b>Allison Geer</b>, Senior Director in C&amp;M marketing. The unit closed for <b>$1.9M</b> at a health system in Florida—but it wasn’t only the size and scope of the engagement that impressed us, it was her commitment to serving her members and supporting C&amp;M throughout the process.</p>

                <p>I sat down with Allison Geer to better understand Mmekom’s contribution.</p>

                <p><mark><b>One Advisory Board:</b></mark> <i>How was Mmekom able to tee you up?</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>Allison Geer:</b></mark> <i>Mmekom was instrumental by outlining the background, opportunity, and contact details. She also provided data from CCC to our consulting team prior to important calls with the member early in our discussions to ensure that we were well prepared and set-up for success.</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>OAB:</b></mark> <i>After getting an introduction to the CMO, did you feel his pre-existing relationship with ABC through their CCC membership was beneficial?</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>AG:</b></mark> <i>Yes, through our existing relationship we were able to gain credibility early in the process and speak very knowledgably about the organization as well as areas of opportunity based on data available within CCC.</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>OAB:</b></mark> <i>Was it immediately apparent that they needed consulting?</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>AG:</b></mark> <i>Yes, in the first interaction we had with the CMO and representatives of his team it was very clear that they needed consulting support. They had been severely misled by a previous partner about savings opportunities and were very concerned about meeting the organizations financials goals for the year ahead. It was clear that action needed to be taken and they were looking for a partner that they could trust. Our ability to draw upon our existing relationships with the member and leverage CCC were significant advantages.</i></p>

                 <p><mark><b>OAB:</b></mark> <i>Anything else you would like to share?</i></p>

                <p><mark><b>AG:</b></mark> <i>This was the first solution deal for the Hospital Performance Management and Spend Performance Management teams, which was a great learning opportunity. Now we’re all in search for the next big unit! Hopefully there are more Mmekoms out there to help us.</i></p>

                <p><b>A sincere thank you to Mmekom for keeping her eyes peeled, we’re very grateful for your efforts!</b></p>

                <p>With 2015 in the books, the MBA program is looking for its next MVP. If you’re not enrolled in the program already, visit the <a class="bluelink" href="http://one.advisory.com/campaigns/cmmba.html" target="blank"><u>MBA homepage</u></a> and submit a request for a session.</p>

                <h3><a name="post125">Introducing... The First Recipient of the David Felsenthal OAB Award</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Spoiler alert: she's cracked the code on OAB awesomeness</mark></i></h4>

                <p>On a chilly winter evening in January, 81 of the firm’s top 2015 One Advisory Board lead passers were invited to an exclusive event at Café Deluxe to celebrate their accomplishments. Top performers and executives like Adam Spiegel and David Felsenthal enjoyed delicious food and beverages as they looked back on a remarkable 2015.</p>

                <p>In order to attend the reception, invitees must have achieved OAB Platinum Medallion status, meaning they passed OAB leads in 2015 that resulted in 15 or more marketing visits. One individual in particular passed 170.5 leads which resulted in 84 visits. That made her the #1 OAB visit generator at the firm last year.</p>

                <p>Who may you ask are we referring to? None other than <b>Caitlin Ursini</b>, the first-time recipient of the <b>Annual David Felsenthal OAB Award</b>.</p>

                <img class="featurephoto" src="../img/blog/ursinifelsenthal.png">

                <p>The award was created to recognize one individual for their outstanding contributions to the firm through One Advisory Board in a given year. While the numbers speak for themselves (see below), Caitlin was deserving of this award for many other reasons. OAB’s most successful campaign, the H2 Visit Tournament, pits the firm’s top 64 lead passers against each other in a battle for the vacation of a lifetime. Caitlin has made it all the way to the <b>Final Four in both 2014 and 2015</b>, which is no small feat. She also reached the status of <b>Platinum level lead passer in both 2014 and 2015</b>.</p>

Initially, the event started as a way to showcase the best local bands, but it has grown over the years to include local designers, interactive workshops, and art showings. This year, the lineup includes: American Football, Metric, Drive like Jehu, The Mountain Goats, Vince Staples, Parquet Courts, The Cave Singers, and a number of other bands that probably only your most hipster friends have heard of. But, don’t let that deter you. The White Stripes, Modest Mouse, the Flaming Lips, and Death Cab for Cutie all played Noise Pop before hitting it big.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>How C&amp;M Practice Management is changing the ASC game</mark></i></h4>

                <p>In 2013, the Daily Briefing said that <a class="bluelink" href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2013/01/31/ambulatory-surgery-centers-may-soon-outnumber-hospitals" target="blank"><b>“Ambulatory Surgery Centers may soon outnumber hospitals”</b></a>, and it seems they were onto something. Currently, the number of Medicare-certified ASC’s is rapidly catching up to the number of registered hospitals. Increased competition means that the time has come for healthcare leaders to consider how they can get the most out of their ASCs, or if they aren’t already partnered, to evaluate their options.</p>

                <p>This is why C&amp;M Practice Management service line is rolling out its new ASC engagement, led by <b>Stephen Faro</b> and <b>Anthony D’Eredita</b>. They are offering Executive Roundtable Sessions during which they will discuss the following questions with executive teams:</p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li class="indent">How ASCs should fit into their overarching ambulatory strategy</li>
                    <li class="indent">New issues facing the ASC industry and what to expect</li>
                    <li class="indent">How to ensure their ASC is operating at its full potential</li>
                </ul>

                <p><b>So how do you know if your members are good candidates for a roundtable? Listen for the following questions:</b></p>

                <ul class="bulletpoints">
                    <li class="indent"><i>How should we prepare for ASC acquisition?</i></li>
                    <li class="indent"><i>How should ASCs fit into our ASCs fit into our population health strategy?</i></li>
                    <li class="indent"><i>What is the right management model for an ASC?</i></li>
                    <li class="indent"><i>What are the various ways to grow the ASC?</i></li>

                <h3><a name="post120">How do we get to $1 Billion?</a></h3>
                <h4><i><mark>Sean Sullinger believes the answer is NOT a winning Powerball ticket</mark></i></h4>

                <p>Over the past few weeks, I have had a revelation about the true nature of One Advisory Board. It doesn’t exist in the parties and incentives, or the campaigns and trips, or even in the people on the receiving end of the OAB inbox. The true nature of One Advisory Board is the servant’s heart that lives inside each and every Advisory Board staff member.</p>

                <p>And right now, everyone at ABC, whether you participate in OAB or not, should feel <i>incredibly</i> proud. 2015, for the first time, <b>leads passed by ABC staff around the world led to more than $100 million in new business</b>, nearly half of ABC’s total revenue again. More people than ever participated, with more than 1000 of you passing at least one lead. And perhaps most rewarding of all, in December, <b>One Advisory Board cleared half-a-billion dollars in cumulative lifetime revenue</b>.</p>

                <p>Not bad considering that just 12 years ago, David Felsenthal and Scott Schirmeier were looking for a program to help find a few million dollars in additional revenue here and there.</p>

                <p>But I know all of you. You aren’t looking for a victory lap – you are looking for a call to do more. So here it is: Just after we hit the $500M mark Scott challenged OAB to get to $1 billion in under five years. <b>I challenge us to do it in three.</b> Before ABC moves in to our new Chinatown office in DC, you will have collectively found more than $1B in new member impact.</p>

                <p>Don’t get me wrong; OAB will continue to keep it fun. New and familiar campaigns will dot the calendar throughout the year; OAB incentives live on, same as they always will; and the OAB team is here to answer any question you have. But the only way One Advisory Board creates $1B of impact (and beyond) is you.</p>

                <h4><i><mark>The Road to 100 Percent</mark></i></h4>

                <p>We have come a long way since the firm first launched in 1979. 37 years later, we have grown from 5 employees working at the Research Counsel to over 2,800 at the Advisory Board Company. We’ve expanded our reach from a single office in Washington to 12 on 3 continents, including one in Chennai, India – over 8,500 miles and a 19-hour journey from D.C.</p>

                <h6 class="bluetext">Despite the many changes, certain core elements of the firm remain the same:</h6>

                <ul class="bullet points">
                    <li class="indent">Culture is a top priority. Our employees are a strong community that fosters career growth, personal connections, and no shortage of opportunity to make a difference.</li>
                    <li class="indent">We continue to create groundbreaking solutions in health care and higher education. Our mission is to make health care better, education smarter, and our communities stronger. And with every passing day, our teams demonstrate their commitment to each aim.</li>
                    <li class="indent">We partner with more than 230,000 leaders at over 5,000 organizations across health care and higher education and always put service to our members first.</li>
                <ul>

                <p>Another constant in our  history is the Health Care Advisory Board. Over the past 30 years, our flagship research program has supported CEOs, COOs and Board Members around the country in tackling challenges from care delivery redesign and health system strategy to payment transformation.</p>

                <p>Today, HCAB is the reigning champion of our membership in guiding hospital leaders, and counts nearly three quarters of all hospitals (72%) as part of the membership. Our role as go-to advisor grants us the privilege of serving as thought partner with the nation’s leading health care organizations and that two-way channel lends tremendous value to the support we provide to our members, across every program, service and technology. Simply put, having a seat at the table with the most senior, progressive executives in health care is critical to our business and allows us to serve all of our members better.</p>

                <p>But, such strong market position now poses a challenge – how can we continue to grow and close the gap? While every organization may not opt in to membership, we must all do our very best to help capture as much of the opportunity that remains for HCAB. Access to CEOs, allows us unparalleled insight into the top strategic challenges in industry and fuels our ability to fulfill our mission – to make health care better.</p>

                <h6 class="bluetext">As the posters decorating the D.C. office may have hinted, the Health Care Advisory Board is launching a new campaign, “The Road to 100 Percent.”</h6> 

                <p>The goal is for the firm to secure interactions with, or gather market intelligence from, the remaining HCAB prospect organizations in an effort to understand and capture as much of the remaining market opportunity as possible. Many of us speak or work with these organizations already—and likely have invaluable insight into the priorities and challenges they are facing.  Or why they may not join at this time, which is equally important for us to understand.</p>


                <h6 class="bluetext">The places our firm can go with new levels of insight from chief executives in every market are endless. Where should we start?</h6>

                <p>As the year comes to a close, the One Advisory Board team has a lot to be grateful for and we’d like to share just a few! Thanks to the hard work of the entire firm – for the first time ever – OAB Leads have contributed to $100M in NBB! This is no small feat and it is because of every one of you that 2015 will go down in the record books.</p>
                
                <p>Our team wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who submitted a lead this year. A few special shout-outs to the groups we harassed the most...</p>

                    <p class="bettext">The One Advisory Board team loves all of our lead passers – from the occasional submitters to the casual repeat offender to the names pinging our inbox every day. We’re thrilled every time we get to chatter out a new medallions status achievement. So far this year, the numbers are <b>82 Platinum, 41 Gold, 102 Silver, and 527 Bronze</b> – meaning 752 of you have secured at least 1 visit from your OAB leads. WOW – color us impressed!</p>

                    <p class="bettext"><b>Marketing</b> and <b>Account Management</b> have been battling it out all year in hopes of winning the coveted prize at the end of the H2 Visit Tournament. We placed an extra hurdle in front of them at the beginning of the year – A Race to Qualify – and they rose to the challenge! At the beginning of H2, there were 64 lead passers pitted against each other in OAB’s Classic March Madness style tournament. Now – only two remain: <b>Sharon Shoham</b> and <b>James Millard</b>. We’d like to thank everyone who participated – we hope to see you in the bracket again next year!</p>

                    <p class="bettext">Across H1, <b>NASA</b> fought in fierce battle, scheduling OAB visits to defend the honor of their GM “houses” and seize control of the iron throne. Dragons were tamed, principal teams were turned into white walkers, and many, many leads were passed. When the great war was over, <b>House Amoruso</b> had scheduled the most visits, earning their seat on the iron throne. </b>Team McKenna</b> was the principal team with the most visits scheduled outside the winning pod, earning them a reward as well. When you play the game of thrones, you either win, or you die… NASA teams learned to keep their friends close and their enemies closer, but even more commendable was the team work we saw in the midst of lead passing battle.</p>

                    <p class="bettext">Throughout H1, <b>PT Delivery</b> and <b>EAB Delivery</b> traveled around the globe, completing difficult lead passing challenges in exchange for stamps on their passports, which would move them onto the next destination. Completing the final round with the most visits, <b>Rachel Wolfowitz</b> claimed the grand prize. <b>Caroline Leone</b> finished close behind her earning the second place prize. The consistently strong lead passing performance demonstrated by 108 participants in the campaign resulted in a total of 217 visits and 60 units from 971 OAB leads. What a trip!</p>

With no lack of Ricky Bobby quotes at every turn, they’ve sped passed our expectations. The race has been close and while we can’t confirm until January who will cross the finish line first – things are looking good for <b>Team Bitton</b>. The real question is who will see the checkered flag second? <b>Team Scott</b> and <b>Team Taylor</b> have been neck and neck the last few weeks.
