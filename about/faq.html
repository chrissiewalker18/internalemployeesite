                <h3>OAB Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

                <p>Anytime you have a question, don't hesitate to contact a member of the One Advisory Board team directly or reach out to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com?Subject=Question%20from%20OAB%20Website" target="_self">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a>. In the meantime, we tried to provide answers to common questions we receive from staff:</p>

            </div>

            <div class="faqanswers">

                <h3>Top Questions:</h3>

                <p> <a name="Q1"><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have to do anything to receive my incentive payment?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong>No, all OAB leads are tracked in Salesforce and incentives are automatically calculated and processed by Finance on a quarterly basis. Still, don't hesitate to reach out to Sean Sullinger with questions about your incentives.</p>

                <p> <a name="Q2"><strong>Q: </strong>How long does it take to receive an incentive payment?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong>OAB incentives are paid quarterly. You should receive your incentive payment in the mid-month pay period during the second month of the quarter <i>after</i> the visit or unit date. For example, if the visit takes place in October, you should expect to receive your incentive in the Feb. 15 pay period. </p>

                <p> <a name="Q5"><strong>Q: </strong>How do I know what type of OAB incentive I am elligible for?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Most people are eligible for the $100/$250 visit incentive, but select departments have slightly different plans. For questions about your departmentâ€™s incentive plan, just ask your manager!</p>

                <p> <a name="Q3"><strong>Q: </strong>What happened to a lead I passed?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong> <u><a href="tracker/OABOnlineTracker.xlsx">Use the OAB Tracker</a></u> to see all of your leads and any visits and NBB resulting from your leads. If you have further questions, feel free to contact <u><a href="mailto:OneAdvisory@Advisory.com">OneAdvisory@Advisory.com</a></u>.</p>

                <p> <a name="Q4"><strong>Q: </strong>I don't know what product the lead is for, can I still pass it?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Yes! Just tell us what the member said or the area where they have a challenge and we will map it to the right product and connect you with the marketing team.</p>

                

                <p> <a name="Q6"><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have One Advisory Board goals as part of my career committee?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Some member-facing staff, like PT Dedicated Advisors, have One Advisory Board goals as part of their Career Committee metrics. DAs are goaled against "Success Metrics" which are defined as visits and units resulting from leads. DAs need at least 1 Success Metric during each career committee period. You can check your metrics and goals in the <u><a href="../tracker/OABOnlineTracker.xlsx">OAB Tracker</a></u>. Please check with your manager about your OAB career committee metrics.</p>
