            <h3>What is <mark>One Advisory Board</mark>?</h3>

                <p>One Advisory Board was born in 2004 as the firm was transitioning from a research provider to a true Solutions company through the introduction of Performance Technology, Consulting and Management, and Talent Development. The increasing number of offerings meant an increasingly complex firm for members to navigate and more ABC staff reaching out to members.</p>

                <p> <b>One Advisory Board</b> was put in place to serve as a central location for staff to share their members' questions and challenges, and to be connected with the appropriate resource at the firm.</p>

                <p> <b>Our Ask of You:</b> When a member has a question, challenge, or priority that falls outside of the scope of their current memberships, send that information to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com?Subject=Question%20from%20OAB%20Website" target="_self">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a>. You will then be connected to the marketing team for the product best served to help your member so that you, the marketing team, and any other relevant ABC staff can work together to follow up with the member.</p>

            <h3>What's in it for the <mark>Member</mark>?</h3>

                <p>Alerting One Advisory Board when a member has a challenge allows the Advisory Board to proactively work to solve the member's challenge and reduces the amount of contact the member receives from the Advisory Board about topics and services that are not relevant to their current needs.</p>

            <div class="bodytopic">

            <h3>What's in it for the <mark>Advisory Board</mark>?</h3>

                <p>Intelligence about member challenges helps the Advisory Board more efficiently target sales efforts, reduces the amount of commercial contact needed to secure marketing visits, and produces visits that are more likely to result in a sale.</p>

            <h3>What's in it for <mark>You</mark>?</h3>

                <p>ABC Staff submitting leads to One Advisory Board earn incentive payments for leads resulting in visits. All non-marketers are eligible for the following incentives:</p>
