            <h3>What is <mark>One Advisory Board</mark>?</h3>

                <p>One Advisory Board was born in 2004 as the firm was transitioning from a research provider to a true Solutions company. The additional offerings meant an increasingly complex firm for members to navigate and more Advisory Board staff reaching out to members.</p>

                <p> <b>One Advisory Board</b> was put in place to serve as a central location for staff to share their members' questions and challenges, and to be connected with the appropriate resource at the firm.</p>

                <p> <b>Our Ask of You:</b> When a member has a question, challenge, or priority that falls outside of the scope of their current memberships, send that information to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com?Subject=Question%20from%20OAB%20Website" target="_self">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a>. You will then be connected to the marketing team for the product best served to help your member so that you, the marketing team, and any other relevant Advisory Board staff can work together to follow up with the member.</p><br>

            <h4>What's in it for the <mark>Member</mark>?</h4>

                <p>Alerting One Advisory Board when a member has a challenge allows Advisory Board to proactively work to solve the member's challenge and reduces the amount of contact the member receives from the Advisory Board about topics and services that are not relevant to their current needs.</p><br>

            <h4>What's in it for the <mark>Advisory Board</mark>?</h4>

                <p>Intelligence about member challenges helps the Advisory Board more efficiently target sales efforts, reduces the amount of commercial contact needed to secure marketing visits, and produces visits that are more likely to result in a sale.</p><br>

            <h4>What's in it for <mark>You</mark>?</h4>

                <p>ABC Staff submitting leads to One Advisory Board earn incentive payments for leads resulting in visits. All non-marketers are eligible for the following incentives:</p><br>

            <div class="incentives">

                    <h5> <mark> $100 </mark> for OAB leads resulting in Research and Talent Development visits </h5>   
                    <h5> <mark> $100 </mark> for OAB leads resulting in non-CXO Technology and Consulting visits </h5>

                    <h5> <mark> $250 </mark> for OAB leads resulting in <u>CXO-level</u> Technology and Consulting visits </h5>

                    <br>

                    <h4><i>For H2 2016 only... OAB Double Dollars!</i></h4>

                    <h5 class="indent"> <mark> $200 </mark> for OAB leads resulting in Research visits, Talent Development visits, Technology or Consulting visits (no C-level attendee) </h5>

                    <h5 class="indent"> <mark> $500 </mark> for OAB leads resulting in Technology or Consulting visits (C-level attendee)</h5>

            <h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>
                
                <p>Anytime you have a question, don't hesitate to contact a member of the One Advisory Board team directly or reach out to <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:oneadvisory@advisory.com?Subject=Question%20from%20OAB%20Website" target="_self">oneadvisory@advisory.com</a>. In the meantime, we tried to provide answers to common questions we receive from staff:</p>

                <p> <a name="Q1"><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have to do anything to receive my incentive payment?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong>No, all OAB leads are tracked in Salesforce and incentives are automatically calculated and processed by Finance on a quarterly basis. Still, don't hesitate to reach out to Sean Sullinger with questions about your incentives.</p>

                <p> <a name="Q2"><strong>Q: </strong>How long does it take to receive an incentive payment?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong>OAB incentives are paid quarterly. You should receive your incentive payment in the mid-month pay period during the second month of the quarter <i>after</i> the visit or unit date. For example, if the visit takes place in October, you should expect to receive your incentive in the Feb. 15 pay period. </p>

                <p> <a name="Q5"><strong>Q: </strong>How do I know what type of OAB incentive I am elligible for?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Most people are eligible for the $100/$250 visit incentive, but select departments have slightly different plans. For questions about your departmentâ€™s incentive plan, just ask your manager!</p>

                <p> <a name="Q3"><strong>Q: </strong>What happened to a lead I passed?</a> <br> <strong>A: </strong> <u><a href="tracker/OABOnlineTracker.xlsx">Use the OAB Tracker</a></u> to see all of your leads and any visits and NBB resulting from your leads. If you have further questions, feel free to contact <u><a href="mailto:OneAdvisory@Advisory.com">OneAdvisory@Advisory.com</a></u>.</p>

                <p> <a name="Q4"><strong>Q: </strong>I don't know what product the lead is for, can I still pass it?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Yes! Just tell us what the member said or the area where they have a challenge and we will map it to the right product and connect you with the marketing team.</p>

                

                <p> <a name="Q6"><strong>Q: </strong>Do I have One Advisory Board goals as part of my career committee?</a> <br><strong>A: </strong>Some member-facing staff, like PT Dedicated Advisors, have One Advisory Board goals as part of their Career Committee metrics. DAs are goaled against "Success Metrics" which are defined as visits and units resulting from leads. DAs need at least 1 Success Metric during each career committee period. You can check your metrics and goals in the <u><a href="../tracker/OABOnlineTracker.xlsx">OAB Tracker</a></u>. Please check with your manager about your OAB career committee metrics.</p>
