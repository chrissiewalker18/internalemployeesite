                <h4 class="purple">What is the H2 Visit Tournament?</h4>

                <p>The One Advisory Board H2 Visit Tournament is an annual contest pitting 64 OAB Lead Passers against each other in an effort to win the vacation of a lifetime.</p>

                <p>The firm's top 64 visit generators from H1 2016 are entered into are entered into a NCAA-style bracket.  Each month in H2 is a round.  In each round, two lead passers are matched up against one another. The lead passer with the most visits from their leads occurring in that month wins the matchup and moves onto the next round. Units converting as a result of your leads in that month will also count towards your score. All ties will be broken by the highest number of leads passed that month. If a match-up ends tied 0-0, both lead passers be eliminated and replaced by a "Wild-Card" contestant represented by the top scorer among the losers from that round.</p>

                <p>The last competitor standing at the end of the 6 month tournament wins an unbelievable international trip for two (last year we sent James Millard to Fiji!)</p>

                <p>The first runner up receives an awesome vacation for two in a U.S. destination. An additional second place domestic trip prize to the eliminated competitor with the highest cumulative OAB visit number in H2. This means that even those who are eliminated in early rounds of the bracket have just as high a chance as anyone else to win an amazing vacation!</p>

                <p>The Tournament is an example of the theory of Gamification – the use of game elements in non-game scenarios to motivate individuals – within One Advisory Board. In the first year of the tournament, the Top 64 Lead Passers improved their output by 98% compared to the year prior.  The following year, the Top 64 showed an additional 50% growth.  Overall, the H2 Visit Tournament is the most successful campaign in the One Advisory Board library.</p>
