            	<p><a href="https://www.advisory.com/research/health-care-advisory-board/members" target="blank"><u>Health Care Advisory Board</u></a> is the reigning champion of our membership in guiding hospital leaders, and <b>counts nearly three quarters of all hospitals (72%) as part of the membership</b>. Over the past 30 years, our flagship research program has supported CEOs, COOs and Board Members around the country in tackling challenges from care delivery redesign and health system strategy to payment transformation.</p>

                <p>Our role as go-to advisors grants us the privilege of serving as thought partners with the nation’s leading health care organizations. That two-way channel lends tremendous value to the support we provide to our members, across every program, service and technology. Having a seat at the table with the most senior, progressive executives in health care is critical to our business and allows us to serve all of our members better.</p>

                <p><b>The goal of this initiative is for the firm to secure interactions with, or gather market intelligence from, the remaining HCAB prospect organizations in an effort to understand and capture as much of the remaining market opportunity as possible.</b></p>

                <p>Many of us speak or work with these organizations already—and likely have invaluable insight into the priorities and challenges they are facing. Or why they may not join at this time, which is equally important for us to understand. If you have intelligence on why specific HCAB prospects are not likely to join, or would like a list of top target prospects, please contact <a class="emaillink" href="mailto:MurrayA@advisory.com?subject=HCAB Road to 100 Percent">Alexis Murray</a>.</p>
